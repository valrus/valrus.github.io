        Review: <em>In the Dream House</em>
    </h1>
    
    <subtitle>
        SPL Book Bingo 2022, Book 6
    </subtitle>
    
    <p>Note: This is the sixth in a series of posts about books I read for
<a
href="https://www.spl.org/programs-and-services/authors-and-books/2022-book-bingo">Seattle
Public Library’s 2022 Book Bingo</a>. It fills the
<em>Latina/Latino/Latinx author</em> square on the bingo card, and I
suppose it could theoretically fit the <em>LGBTQ+ love story</em> one as
well, in letter if perhaps not in spirit. I’m posting this one before
the fifth book I read because I own that one, but <em>In the Dream
House</em> has to go back to the library.</p>
<p>Compared to all the other books so far, I read <em>In the Dream
House</em> very fast, in the same way that if your house was on fire,
you would run out very fast.</p>
<p>Carmen Maria Machado’s first book, <em>Her Body and Other
Parties</em>, made a splash upon its release. It was a collection of
visceral, sensual short stories that bordered on the upsetting, and I
have a distinct memory of reading it while waiting for a bus in downtown
Seattle. “<a href="https://granta.com/The-Husband-Stitch/">The Husband
Stitch</a>,” which may be its hallmark story<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">Or just its
most-freely-available-on-the-internet.<br />
<br />
</span></span>, shares many concerns with <em>In the Dream House</em>:
intense, consuming love shot through with danger; women’s bodily
autonomy; stories viewed and refracted ominously through other
stories.</p>
<p>It’s no spoiler to say that <em>In the Dream House</em> is about an
abusive relationship. Even if you don’t read the book jacket, or
anything about the book, Machado reveals as much in the prologue.</p>
<p>“The Husband Stitch” was notable, in small part, for how it both
subverted traditional fairy tales and didn’t. In <em>Dream House</em>,
Machado employs a similar tension between her prologue and the preceding
“Overture,” which reads, in its entirety:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I never read prologues. I find them tedious. If what the author has
to say is so important, why relegate it to the paratext? What are they
trying to hide?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The prologue that follows, then, certainly starts out like a text
that has something to hide, like it’s trying to be tedious to obscure
something and not quite succeeding. But after seven scholarly, allusive
paragraphs that cite Derrida and Borges and Greek etymology and
generally feel like the intro to a doctoral dissertation, Machado
finally lays it out there plainly, a woman with something to say and
nothing to hide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I enter into the archive that domestic abuse between partners who
share a gender identity is both possible and not uncommon, and that it
can look something like this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“This” is, narratively, a fractured but generally linear series of
some 150 or so vignettes ranging from a few pages to a single paragraph,
each titled in the following style: “<em>Dream House</em> as Lesbian
Cult Classic.” “<em>Dream House</em> as Chekhov’s Gun.” “<em>Dream
House</em> as a Lesson in the Subjunctive.” It’s stylistically dazzling
and, because it doesn’t linger on any one moment for too long, as easy
to read as it must have been hard to write. But still, the overall
effect is that of a horror story.</p>
<p>Almost all of <em>In the Dream House</em> is in second person, so
that it’s <em>you</em>, reader, in the dream house in an increasingly
untenable situation. If you are inclined to wonder why someone in this
situation would stay, it seems to point the finger back at you: <em>why
are you still reading, then?</em> Because you want to see it through,
one way or another. Because despite how harrowing it is, it’s compelling
and even captivating. Because you want to see how bad it can get, though
not one single drop of blood is shed. Spoiler that is not a spoiler: it
can get pretty fucking bad.</p>
<p><em>In the Dream House</em> is a challenging book: easy to read but
very hard to linger on. Still, despite that I usually prefer my
entertainment less fraught, I thought it was fantastic. The thing is
that while it’s hard material to read about, it’s not unrelenting.
Machado often pulls back from the nightmare that makes up the bulk of
the narrative to take hindsight-informed, more expansive looks at her
situation, to understand and contextualize it. The framing device is
brilliant, and Machado does some very clever, inventive things with it.
And throughout, the writing is just outstanding: it pulls you into the
all-too-common tense and oppressive moments, but the more dispassionate
chapters are sharp and insightful and there are even some very darkly
funny bits.</p>
<p>So there it is: you know what you’re getting into if you read <em>In
the Dream House</em>, but I really think you should. Does it help if I
tell you it has an almost implausibly happy ending?</p>
