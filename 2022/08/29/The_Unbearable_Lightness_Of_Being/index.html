    <h1>Review: <em>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</em></h1>
    
    <subtitle>SPL Book Bingo 2022, Book 9</subtitle>
    
    <p>Note: This is the ninth in a series of posts about books I read for
<a
href="https://www.spl.org/programs-and-services/authors-and-books/2022-book-bingo">Seattle
Public Library’s 2022 Book Bingo</a>. It fills the <em>Banned or
challenged book</em> square on the bingo card, according to a display at
my local library; I assumed this was because of its sexual content, but
it was actually banned <em>in Czechoslovakia</em> due to its criticism
of the Communist government.</p>
<p>So, <em>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</em> was basically fine. I
find that I have a notion of it in my head as a book that enjoyed a
period of hipness in America, maybe because of the efficient
set-em-up-and-knock-em-down summary in Maciej Cegłowski’s <a
href="https://idlewords.com/2005/11/dating_without_kundera.htm">Dating
Without Kundera</a>. It has some of the trappings that I could see a hip
book having — the frank (but never actually sexy) depictions of sex, the
pseudo-profound philosophical musings of an omniscient narrator, the mix
of political struggle and tawdry personal drama — and while each of
these components may have been more or less compelling in their own way,
they never gelled into anything greater than the sum of their parts.</p>
<p>I don’t know. Sometimes I’m lukewarm on a book but it still gives me
things to think about. This one was just fine, and I have no desire to
think about it any more. The narrator’s bloviations were generally
laughable. The depiction of life under an oppressive Communist regime
was convincingly tense, though it never really seemed to have any
stakes. The gender politics were embarrassing: the women have some
agency but seem constantly driven by their neuroses, whereas the men’s
drives are treated as implacable forces of nature. I don’t think it
passed the Bechdel test. So rather than face The Unbearable Prospect of
Writing Another Word About This Book,</p>
