    <p>Note: This is the first in a series of posts about books I read for
<a
href="https://www.spl.org/programs-and-services/authors-and-books/2022-book-bingo">Seattle
Public Library’s 2022 Book Bingo</a>. This book could fill any of the
following squares on the bingo card: <em>Debut author</em>, <em>Sci-fi
or fantasy by a BIPOC author</em>, <em>Recommended by Library staff or
Peak Pick</em>, <em>Been meaning to read</em>,
<em>Non-binary/genderqueer author or character</em>, or <em>LGBTQ+ love
story</em>.</p>
<p><a href="/containers/music/music2010">I’ve been a fan of Janelle
Monáe’s music</a> since her 2010 debut LP <em>The ArchAndroid</em>, and
being quite familiar with her whole discography did not equip me with
any intuitions about what to expect from Monáe’s short story collection
and first book. <em>The ArchAndroid</em>, together with the
<em>Metropolis: The Chase Suite</em> EP that preceded it and <em>The
Electric Lady</em> which followed, sort of kind of tells some kind of
story. Or at least their songs are all kind of set in the same science
fictional city, with a plotline of sorts that’s pervasive in the
<em>Metropolis</em> EP but gradually disintegrates into a loose theme in
the genre-hopping second half of <em>ArchAndroid</em> and is dropped
almost entirely in <em>Electric Lady</em>. And Monáe’s most recent album
<em>Dirty Computer</em>, on which this book is actually based, leaves
Metropolis entirely and has no claim to a linear plot.</p>
<p>All this is just as well, as music that tries to hew too close to a
coherent plotline often sacrifices what makes a good album to do so. But
it means that Monáe’s music doesn’t give a good sense of what to expect
from her as a fiction writer. Too, each of <em>The Memory
Librarian</em>’s five stories was written with a different collaborator.
So all this is to reiterate that I went into this book fully expecting
it to thwart any of my preconceived notions about it.</p>
<p><em>The Memory Librarian</em> does not read like a book from a
musician dilettante written as a vanity project, as I feared it might.
Its references to Monáe’s music are subtle and tasteful. The title,
“Pynk,” of a song about feminine solidarity is repurposed as an
all-woman creative refuge, and one that’s defiantly, unambiguously
trans-inclusive, as though Monáe wanted to shake off any lingering
accusations of exclusion in the song itself. References to misfits and
outcasts as “dirty computers,” used mainly as a sort of reclaimed slur,
are very in keeping with her LP of the same name. An underground radio
DJ from <em>The Electric Lady</em> makes a cameo. These are nice little
touches for fans, but they don’t dominate the experience of reading the
book.</p>
<p>The stories don’t have much of a throughline, besides the oppressive
surveillance regime New Dawn that serves as the direct or indirect
antagonist of almost every main character. I think they would have
benefited from a few more connections to flesh out the world a bit more
and make it feel a bit more cohesive and fully realized. As it is,
though, it’s easier for me to think about them in isolation, and I’m
going to indulge myself and rank them. I will try to avoid any
significant spoilers.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“Timebox.” Written with Eve L. Ewing. Perhaps not coincidentally,
also the shortest story. These things coincide not because I wanted any
of these stories to be over sooner, but because this one is more compact
and economical: it sets up a situation relatively quickly, maintains a
sense of tension and vague dread for its entire length, and ends with an
effective gut punch. It’s the least dependent on its setting — it could
easily be set in present-day America — and its antagonist is believably
well-meaning but despicable nonetheless. Most effective, though, is that
tension. The main character is at the end of her rope and you really
feel her lack of support, and feel for her.</li>
<li>“Save Changes.” Written with Yohanca Delgado. A real classic
short-story-ass short story with the classic third-act reversal, and
characters rendered well enough to make it count, to make the stakes
feel high.</li>
<li>“Nevermind.” Written with Danny Lore. Novella-sized. The most
action-packed sci-fi thing here. A real post-apocalyptic hardscrabble
kind of setting, with shades of <em>Parable of the Sower</em>, but with
more joy mixed in. I’m ambivalent because the ending is a bit
heavy-handed, but Pynk Hotel is a well-realized refuge and its
inhabitants’ struggle to be better than their oppressors in hard
situations is a convincing one.</li>
<li>“The Memory Librarian.” Written with Alaya Dawn Johnson. A decent
story that suffers from — if you’ll allow me a music analogy — a strange
sequencing choice. Having the first story set in the heart of New Dawn,
before we really get a chance to see New Dawn’s effect on those outside
it, kind of mutes its impact. It’s disorienting in a way that didn’t
work for me.</li>
<li>“Timebox Altar(ed).” Written with Sheree Renée Thomas. The most
heavy-handed of the five, with too high a showing-to-telling ratio. Its
hopeful visions are stirring but don’t feel completely earned. This is
the story that I think would have benefitted most from having more
threads running through the whole book: the dreams these characters are
having are the kind that need solidarity, a mass movement, to achieve.
But the characters we see in this book all occupy their own islands,
large or small.</li>
</ol>
<p>All in all, though, <em>The Memory Librarian</em> is as good a read
as I hoped it would be (which is to say: quite good, but less than
amazing). It’s consistent with the world that Janelle Monáe has set up
in her music, where marginalized people manage to thrive even in a world
that tries to squash or erase them, but it stands satisfyingly apart
from that music as well.</p>
