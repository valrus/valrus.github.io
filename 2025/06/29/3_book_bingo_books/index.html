    <h1>3 More Book Bingo Books</h1>
    
    <p>I am still plugging away at <a
href="https://www.spl.org/programs-and-services/authors-and-books/book-bingo/2025-book-bingo">Book
Bingo</a>, possibly vaguely attempting to get a blackout (by filling all
24 squares) this year. That’s a lot of blog posts if they’re all as long
as most of my past ones, so here’s a few quickies.</p>
<section id="sylvie-cathrall-a-letter-from-the-lonesome-shore"
class="level2">
<h2>Sylvie Cathrall, <em>A Letter from the Lonesome Shore</em></h2>
<p>For the “Author from Another Continent” square. The boringest
possible choice for “another continent,” I know, as Cathrall is from
England, but I read this on my mom’s recommendation and this was the
only square it fit. It’s the second book in Cathrall’s Sunken Archive
duology, whose first book was <em>A Letter to the Luminous Deep</em>,
which I liked but didn’t love, and I felt much the same way about this
one.</p>
<p>This second installment was a bit more lively than the first, which
had a pretty overwhelming setup-to-payoff ratio and also earned my ire
for nowhere indicating that it was the first in a series. In
<em>Lonesome Shore</em> the setup’s mostly all been done, and it
actually has a conclusion, so the pacing of the plot is much less uneven
(though it does still feel like most of the actual events happen in the
last 10%). The prose remains kinda overwrought and samey, the characters
equal parts endearing and annoying. But the introduction of some new
weirdos helps mix it up a bit and gives this book a sense of mystery and
stakes that the first sort of lacked. There’s still a marked dearth of
interpersonal conflict, which feels like a bit of a missed opportunity
because the characters’ hearts are all so good. Let’s see that goodness
given an actual workout!</p>
<p>Final note: One thing that this book and its predecessor made me
hungry for is an epistolary novel that <em>doesn’t</em> rely on its
correspondents’ photographic memories to tell a story that’s
indistinguishable from a conventional narrative. Such a book would have
lacunae for its reader to fill in, and writers with their own agendas,
acknowledged or not, that inform what they choose to include, and what
they omit. They’d misremember and forget things. It would be more of a
challenge to read, but the obfuscation would paradoxically feel more
honest than what the Sunken Archives books do.</p>

<section id="john-scalzi-starter-villain" class="level2">
<h2>John Scalzi, <em>Starter Villain</em></h2>
<p>For the “Humor” square. This was the library’s suggestion, not mine;
for the most part I didn’t think this book was <em>especially</em>
funny, or even that being funny was its primary goal. But it was another
breezy, enjoyable romp<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">Everyone calls John Scalzi books “romps” and I’m afraid
I’m no exception. I’m sorry! The man writes romps!!!<br />
<br />
</span></span> of the sort typical of Scalzi. It didn’t make me think,
or do anything that felt particularly new. It was just a fun, very
well-plotted and -told story.</p>
<p>Weirdly, what I’m appreciating most about Scalzi right now, having
read this and <em>Zoë’s Tale</em> recently, is his restraint and good
judgment, at least in the prose. <em>Starter Villain</em> has talking
cats, which in the hands of a less judicious writer might be overused,
or cliché, or otherwise cringey.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">The dolphins straddle the line of self-indulgence a
bit, but they don’t overstay their welcome.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Likewise telling <em>Zoë’s Tale</em> in first person,
with a teenage girl as the POV character. But in both cases Scalzi does
an admirable job of not giving in to stereotypes or telling the obvious
jokes. In the same vein, <em>Villain</em>’s protagonist (haha) isn’t
transformed by his circumstances into some kind of badass. Aside from
keeping his composure in the face of hostility a <em>bit</em> better
than I’d expect of a normal person—which I actually think is somewhat
explained by his having been a journalist and a substitute teacher—he
remains a fish out of water, dependent on his more experienced
colleagues to cover for him. It’s refreshing! But it is possible that
I’m just willing to cut Scalzi some slack, and not read too critically,
because his books are just so damn <em>likable</em>.</p>
</section>
<section id="david-baldacci-to-die-for" class="level2">
<h2>David Baldacci, <em>To Die For</em></h2>
<p>For the “Buddy Read” square. I read this with my book club, which is
entirely composed of men at least 20 years my senior, and like
<em>Starter Villain</em> I couldn’t find any other bingo squares to put
it in. Also like <em>Starter Villain</em>, this was a brisk,
unchallenging read. But I found it much less likeable, and the prose
ranged from serviceable down to clunky. The twisty, compelling plot was
well put together, not that I’m particularly good at detecting plot
holes, but the characters were two-dimensional and not very interesting.
It was fine! I read the whole thing and enjoyed it well enough. But I
don’t think I’ll be seeking out any Baldacci in the future.</p>
