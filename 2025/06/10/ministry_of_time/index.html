    <h1><em>The Ministry of Time</em> by Kaliane Bradley</h1>
    
    <subtitle>SPL Book Bingo 2025, Book 2: Great Escapes</subtitle>
    
    <p>I’ve been trying more often to read novels with <em>no</em> knowledge
about their plot. I don’t remember when I decided to start doing this,
nor do I remember there being a single dramatic “this is the last straw”
type event that pushed me into this slightly unconventional approach to
fiction. But I’m enjoying it, because even the most anodyne back-cover
or inside-flap synopses typically actually reveal quite a lot about a
book’s plot. Going in completely ignorant means I’m not saddled with
expectations about what I think a book “should” be based on a summary
whose purpose is to sell me something. (And it’s interesting to read
these summaries for the first time <em>after</em> I’ve read the book
being summarized.)</p>
<p>I did this with <em>The Ministry of Time</em>, and in retrospect I
think the book jacket’s summary would have left me room to be surprised
as the story sort of cycles through various genres as it runs its
course. I found its leisurely, comedic first section to be the most
enjoyable, but even as the various temporal “expats” charmingly meet and
get to know one another, there’s considerable foreshadowing that the
novel will become something more grim and distressing. It ends up feelin
a bit unbalanced, and an awful lot happens in the last two chapters, but
it does at least feel decently set up by the narrator’s many ominous
musings interspersed with the situational comedy/slice-of-life/romance
that precedes everything going pretty much to hell.</p>
<p>How much you will like <em>The Ministry of Time</em> may depend on
your patience for the author’s specific brand of self-indulgence,
expressed both in similes like “my brain balanced on unconsciousness
like an insect’s foot on the meniscus of a pond” and in, well, writing a
novel which is basically a self-insert fan fiction about a hot Victorian
sailor. For the most part, I loved it. The similes were evocative and
gorgeous way more often than they were confusing or overwrought and the
fish-out-of-water antics of the expats were consistently charming and
often hilarious.</p>
<p>Aside from its being a bit tonally abrupt, I do feel the ending
worked well the more I think about it. It brings in a lot of heaviness
that’s hinted at in the preceding material: some by the narrator’s own
retrospectively expressed regrets and some by increasingly adversarial
conversations between her and the Ministry’s only other non-white
character that are so laden with subtext I had a lot of trouble picking
up on what was <em>really</em> going on. But what I was able to glean
was that the main character’s willful ignorance (a self-defence
mechanism, one supposes, not unrelated to her ethnicity and those
fraught conversations) about what’s going on at the edges of her scope
of influence at the Ministry leads her to be blindsided when it turns
out to be less than benign. Despite that she’s pretty clearly a
less-than-reliable narrator, I was caught off guard by it too.</p>
<p>Like my recent tendency to dive into novels with no foreknowledge of
their plot, I’ve realized one of my characteristics as a fiction reader
is guilelessness.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">Naïveté, if you prefer.<br />
<br />
</span></span> When a book has a big twist or surprising reveal, I very
rarely see it coming. I like books with unreliable narrators because
they fool me every time. And in the case of <em>The Ministry of
Time</em>, the unnamed narrator’s blind spots became my own. So it’s
possible that I felt caught off-guard by the ending because, like the
narrator, I was just not seeing the signs. But it sure was fun until the
shit hit the fan.</p>
