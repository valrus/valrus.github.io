    <h1>
        <em>The Library at Mount Char</em> by Scott Hawkins
    </h1>
    
    <subtitle>
        SPL Book Bingo 2025, Book 1: Found Family
    </subtitle>
    
    <p>Recently I had a pretty delightful conversation that started from the
question “What’s <em>your</em> lesbian necromancer science-fantasy
book?” This referred, of course, to Tamsyn Muir’s first novel <em>Gideon
the Ninth</em>, which I had just finished describing to my interlocutors
with hand-waving enthusiasm, but also metonymically to the general class
of “things one can’t help but employ gesticulation when discussing.”
Less verbosely: <em>what are you into?</em></p>
<p>You will never know the contents of that conversation, unless you
were there (hi!), because it’s not my information to share. I mention it
for two reasons: (1) because I heartily recommend “What are you into?”
as a conversation starter, and (2) because I am extremely into
<em>Gideon the Ninth</em> and the Locked Tomb series in general. And I
mention <em>that</em> in the context of <em>The Library at Mount
Char</em>, which is the first book I read for Seattle Public Library’s
<a
href="https://www.spl.org/programs-and-services/authors-and-books/book-bingo/2025-book-bingo">2025
Adult Book Bingo</a>, because some friends recommended it to me as an
if-you-liked-this-you-might-like-that stopgap while I (and a million
other sickos, aforementioned friends included) wait for the fourth and
presumably final Locked Tomb novel.</p>
<p>I actually didn’t pick this book up intending to populate a Book
Bingo square with it, but after reading it, the idea of describing it as
a “found family” book was too hilarious to resist. And in the interest
of avoiding egregious spoilers I will only say that <em>it’s not
wrong</em>.</p>
<p>But anyway, since I read <em>The Library at Mount Char</em> based on
Locked-Tomb-related recommendations, I’m going to go ahead and do a
compare-and-contrast in list format.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Gideon the Ninth</em> has a large cast of characters each of
whom has a certain specific skillset. This is also true of <em>The
Library at Mount Char</em>; in fact the partitioning of knowledge is
sharper and more explicit, as well as being enforced by extreme
violence.</li>
<li>Like the Locked Tomb series, particularly <em>Harrow the Ninth</em>,
<em>Mount Char</em> hangs a lot of its characterization off how fucked
up people can get if they live for an unfathomably long amount of
time.</li>
<li>The Locked Tomb and <em>Mount Char</em> both counterbalance gruesome
physical and emotional trauma against irreverent dialog. The Locked Tomb
worked better for me: I thought the jokes were funnier and the violence
less gratuitous. But <em>Mount Char</em> struck the balance well enough
to keep me reading.</li>
<li>My favorite way to describe the narrative gimmick employed in each
of the Locked Tomb’s books (so far) is that “the point-of-view character
is the one who knows the <em>least</em> about what’s going on.”
<em>Mount Char</em> does not do this. In fact one of the PoV characters
is probably the one who knows the <em>most</em> about what’s going on.
But they’re not going to tell you, the reader, about it. Between that
and the heavy <em>in medias res</em>—heavy in the sense that there are a
lot of <em>res</em> to be <em>in medias</em> of—<em>Mount Char</em> does
evoke kind of a similar experience of pleasant befuddlement. And it does
do a stellar job of expositing a lot of plot elements via showing, not
telling, in the first 60 pages or so.</li>
<li>The Locked Tomb has interesting and complex things to say about a
wide variety of profoundly dysfunctional interpersonal relationships, as
well as “bigger” issues like colonialism and religion. <em>Mount
Char</em> has the dysfunctional relationships but for the most part they
lack TLT’s complexity and subtlety, and the philosophical stuff is
outside its remit. This is fine. It’s a single smaller book and its
scope is appropriate for that. But it has less capacity than TLT for you
to get totally engrossed in it.</li>
<li><em>Mount Char</em> has a satisfying, tidy ending. I very much doubt
this will be true of The Locked Tomb.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all I think The Locked Tomb is not an inapt comparison for
<em>The Library at Mount Char</em>, but I would suggest a couple that I
think are more appropriate. In its progressively bewildering expansions
in conceptual scope I would liken it to <a
href="https://qntm.org/fiction">qntm’s books</a> like <em>Fine
Structure</em> and <em>Ra</em>. In its clashes between real-life deities
and normal-ass people (and, to a lesser extent, the same intentional
tonal dissonance that got it likened to <em>Gideon the Ninth</em>) it
reminds me of nothing so much as the works of Neil Gaiman, <a
href="https://www.eruditorumpress.com/blog/the-cuddled-little-vice-sandman">cursed
be his name</a>. Gaiman might have turned out to be a piece of shit, but
it doesn’t retroactively render his work without merit. <em>The Library
at Mount Char</em> is a worthy descendant of that work.</p>
