    <h1><em>Stony the Road</em> by Henry Louis Gates, Jr.</h1>
    
    <subtitle>SPL Book Bingo 2025, Book 3: BIPOC* Historical Fiction/Nonfiction</subtitle>
    
    <p>Hey have you played <em>Disco Elysium</em>? It’s a video game with
this character in it named Measurehead, who is a physically and verbally
imposing man blocking your passage to a critical location. When you talk
to him to try to get by, he greets you by saying “YOUR BODY BETRAYS YOUR
DEGENERACY,” (capital letters are <em>sic</em>) and the conversation
goes downhill from there. Measurehead, as befits his name, is also an
absolutely huge racist who spouts intricate nonsense about phrenology
and haplogroups to justify his belief that people of his specific
ancestry are destined to claim dominion over the world. I was put in
mind of Measurehead several times while reading <em>Stony the Road</em>
because much of it is an exhausting, uncomfortable deluge of propaganda
used by white people in the years after Reconstruction to portray Black
people as inferior or even subhuman as a pretext for curtailing the
rights they’d only recently been granted upon the (nominal) end of
slavery in the US. It’s not <em>the same</em> as the blatherings of
Measurehead—who, in a grimly amusing inversion, is what we would call
Black (<em>Disco Elysium</em>’s geopolitics parallel the real world’s
but are not the same) and praises the “ham sandwich race” for inventing
such wonders of the world as eugenics and munitions before asserting
their modern-day decadence and softness consigns them to the dustbin of
history—but it certainly rhymes. Reading about the “race scientific”
distinctions between “monogenesis” and “polygenesis” in <em>Stony the
Road</em> was like listening to Measurehead talk about the “three
categories of race” in <em>Disco Elysium</em>. Meticulous
categorization, fractally nuanced rabbit holes of sterile
intellectualizing, every one terminating in a dead end.</p>
<p>I read this book for my book club because some people in it were
curious about the throughline between Reconstruction and the moment we
find ourselves in now. For me, a blinders-on ignoramus who typically
avoids learning about history unless compelled to (this book club has
been very good for that), much of the information was new, or at least
the organization and sheer weight of it was. Despite that my high school
history education was generally at least somewhat willing to acknowledge
the US’s racist history, I don’t recall its being very explicit about
what exactly happened between the Civil War and the civil rights
movement of the 1950s and 60s that resulted in that movement being so
necessary. <em>Stony the Road</em> is very explicit about this:
overwhelmingly so. This is appropriate, because it successfully conveys
that the propaganda was overwhelming—and largely successful in its goal
of convincing people in the South that Black people were too childlike
and naïve to be trusted with their own fate, too savage and violent to
be trusted with white society, or, paradoxically, both.</p>
<p>Aside from describing all this propaganda, the other main branch of
<em>Stony the Road</em> is concerned with the multiple efforts (both in
parallel and sequentially) on the part of Black people to construct a
counter-narrative in the form of a “New Negro,” emancipated not only
from slavery itself but also from the abjection it entailed. The New
Negro was cosmopolitan and literary—and disconnected from less
“cultured” more-recently-emancipated or Southern Black people. This last
might be why none of these reinventions had the desired effect. To use
the twenty-first-century term, they lacked intersectionality. And I was
surprised to see that the term “respectability politics,” or as it
appears here, “the politics of respectability,” dates back to the late
19th century. The educated, “civilized” New Negro was respectability
politics all the way, and the failure of that approach echoes even today
in accusations of “acting white” and how some “conscious” rap music
tries to draw a line between less and more respectable forms of Black
self-expression.</p>
<p>What <em>Stony the Road</em> didn’t do terribly well for me was
synthesize all this into a really cohesive understanding of the
so-called “Redemption” period in which the “redeemed” Southern states
managed to say, essentially, “No thank you” to the changes effected in
Reconstruction. Some of this came through subsequent Supreme Court
rulings that took the sting out of Constitutional amendments and
legislation intended to make Black people (or at least Black men) more
equal under the law. But some of it was just flatly “extra-legal”: the
KKK, lynchings and other acts of terrorism as so-called law enforcement
looked the other way. In one startling statistic, Gates mentions that
the Black voting populations of Louisiana and Alabama decreased from
over 100,000 to under 10,000 in the years following Reconstruction. He
lays out, in some form or another, many of the various mechanisms by
which this occurred, but it’s sort of up to the reader to connect the
dots between those mechanisms, and I don’t think they’re even all
represented. (For example, I seem to recall poll taxes being a
significant part of the curtailing of Black voting rights but they are
not mentioned at all in this book.)</p>
<p><em>Stony the Road</em> did a good job of filling in some significant
gaps in my knowledge of American history. But it was for the most part
not very engaging to read, and it did only a halfway-good job of
assembling its material in a way that really <em>made sense of</em> it.
Notwithstanding, of course, that racism is mostly senseless in the first
place.</p>
