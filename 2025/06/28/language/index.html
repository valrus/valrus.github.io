    <h1>a meander about writing and language</h1>
    
    <p>Recently I wrote about how an essay I read, <a
href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/28-slightly-rude-notes-on-writing">28
Slightly Rude Notes on Writing</a>, made me want to write more. The <a
href="/2025/04/30/little_things">post</a> didn’t have a really sharp
thesis, and it didn’t have an intended audience. This flew in the face
of I’d been led to believe is “good writing,” where it’s important to
know your audience, and to write for that audience, and to have an
objective, and to focus your writing such that it attains that objective
concisely. But in attempting to find links to justify my claim that this
is what’s commonly considered to constitute “good writing,” I found a
different source saying “if it’s not professional, it’s fine to just
write for yourself,” so: I didn’t have an audience or an objective for
that last post and I’m sure as hell not gonna have one here.</p>
<p>But. But but but. When I say I want to write more, but I don’t have a
topic or an audience in mind, what is it I actually want? The phrase
that leaps to my mind is “putting words together.” It is—or can be—a
fun, brain-stretching challenge to choose words, assemble them into
sentences that flow smoothly (or clunk joltingly), stuff sentences full
of digressions in subordinate clauses. To cut long sentences with short
ones. To wrangle paragraphs, each with an arc that feels inevitable,
into a journey that goes somewhere surprising, or at least a little
interesting.</p>
<p>I’m not a professional writer and I don’t claim to be great at this;
it’s still a fun challenge, though. As with all art, the space of
possibilities is too large to navigate any way but intuitively, and I’ve
done enough reading and writing to have some trust in my intuition.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">In the middle of writing this post, I <a
href="https://elftheory.substack.com/p/someone-who-really-gets-you">came
across</a> the aphorism “intuition fails in high dimensions.” Because I
know just enough math to be dangerous, I tend to think of a lot of
things as high-dimensional spaces, so I was somewhat gratified to see
that the phrase <a
href="https://cacm.acm.org/research/a-few-useful-things-to-know-about-machine-learning/">refers
specifically to machine learning</a>.<br />
<br />
</span></span> But! But! The question remains: what’s the point of
writing if it’s not <em>about</em> something? What does “writing for its
own sake” actually look like?</p>
<p>The train of thought that led to this post occurred while I was in
the back seat of a car returning from a family vacation, and somewhere
in my musing I looked out the window at the sky and had what felt like a
slightly sophomoric thought: how could a piece of writing be <em>like a
cloud</em>?</p>
<p>Bear with me. I mean like a cloud in that it doesn’t have a purpose
or a goal: it’s just there, doesn’t need to justify its existence,
doesn’t <em>mean</em> anything. Let me get the obvious out of the way
first: it is not possible to write something like this. There is too
much meaning and human intentionality in language to use it to create
something truly meaningless. But still. What kinds of writing might come
closest to this? A few things come to mind:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Aleatoric writing, by which I mean writing produced in part by
chance. This approach to writing poetry is not uncommon. Legend has it
that many of Radiohead’s Thom Yorke’s lyrics for <em>Kid A</em> and
<em>Amnesiac</em> were “written” this way, by pulling words or phrases
out of a hat (whether the hat is literal or figurative is not known to
me). Legend further has it that the bridge of System of a Down’s “Chop
Suey!” came from Serj Tankian’s pulling a book off Rick Rubin’s shelf,
opening to a random page, and using the first line his eye fell on.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">I confess I personally find it a bit farfetched that
Tankian <em>just happened</em> to flip to what is probably one of the
Bible’s most recognizable turns of phrase, but the point is that this is
a done thing.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>This kind of writing dates back at least to the Dada art movement, as
documented in Allison Parrish’s “<a
href="https://posts.decontextualize.com/language-models-poetry/">Language
models can only write poetry</a>,”<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">Allison Parrish has thought a lot more about the kinds
of things I’m talking about in this post, and she’s written about them
more sharply than I could hope to. I really recommend reading
this.<br />
<br />
</span></span> which has an example formed by the “words from a hat”
method (and argues that the large language models of 2025 are a
sophisticated version of same). Even with this method, it’s impossible
to excise intentionality from the process entirely: you need to choose
the words that you put into the hat. Even if you take them out of a
random book on your shelf, you still (presumably) employed your own
judgment in acquiring that book; even if you use a book you don’t own,
it’s probably in your native language, and so forth. And with a poem
constructed this way, we kind of can’t help but try to ascribe meaning
to it (well, I can’t, anyway). But still, there’s something cloudlike
about a poem constructed this way. After all, clouds aren’t
<em>completely</em> random there are, after all, physical constraints on
their formation that just lack anything we’d call “intentionality.” And
a viewer can still ascribe meaning to a cloud. But there are a couple
other interesting cases I wanted to explore.</p></li>
<li><p>Zen koans. My (Western layperson’s) understanding is that many
koans are self-contradictory, paradoxical, intended to thwart the
reader’s understanding. Of course, even acknowledging that they are
“intended” to do anything means recognizing how they are un-cloudlike.
Text that refuses its own meaning does not become meaningless; the
refusal is layered on top of the meaning rather than nullifying it. But
there is still a cloudlike <em>unconcern</em> to a koan. It may be
intended to help guide the reader towards enlightenment, but it’s not
trying to <em>convince</em>. I think a koan is less like a cloud than a
poem drawn from a hat. But it seems to have a similar indifference to
the reader’s comprehension.</p></li>
<li><p>Haiku. I get the sense that they are generally sort of intended
to convey something about the natural world: often sort of a snapshot in
time, always self-contained, rarely “meaning” anything. Like koans, I do
think haiku are intentful, but the best of them do seem to float like a
cloud, to have been pulled from the air rather than
constructed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If texts from east Asia spring to mind more readily for me here, I
suppose it’s because many seem less intent on persuading or informing
than Western work. I may also have <a
href="https://kenliu.name/blog/book/laozis-dao-de-jing/">Ken Liu’s
translation of the Dao De Jing</a> on the brain, having read it
recently. Much of the Dao De Jing has the flavor of Zen koans, to me: <a
href="https://roadrunnertwice.dreamwidth.org/603805.html">another recent
reader</a> described its tone well as “deliberately aggravating and
provocative, but in a gentle way.” But I bring it up here because in
some of his interstitial commentary, Liu mentions the
<em>inadequacy</em> of language to explain the Dao and how Laozi
basically just wrote it down because his followers asked him to.</p>
<p>I have other thoughts about language churning around and this post
didn’t get to half of what I wanted to set down, but it’s long enough
already. So I’ll leave the rest, ambitiously, for a future
installment.</p>
