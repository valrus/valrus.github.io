    <h1>
        Exterior // Interior
    </h1>
    
    <p>This weekend I spent a little time updating my <a
href="/outside/sit-spot.html">Sit Spot</a> page, a page about literally
doing nothing over and over. I upgraded the back/next arrows from the
clunky, juvenile ⬅️ and ➡️ to svelte, elegant isosceles triangles to
provide a more restrained and cosmopolitan navigation experience. I
added datestamps to the image captions, because what’s the point of
keeping a record of the same nothing nearly every day if you can’t use
it to mark the implacable passage of time? And because adding images was
a tedious, highly manual process involving copy/pasting a directory
listing into a file and tweaking its formatting by hand, and because I
somewhat derangedly made <a
href="https://codeberg.org/valrus/peppermynt">my own fork</a> of a <a
href="https://github.com/uhnomoli/mynt">largely defunct static site
generator</a> and thus can mess with it however I please, I added some
little features to it to alleviate this precise tedium somewhat.</p>
<p>If my web page has a “readership,” it is completely opaque to me — I
have no analytics, no comments, nothing telling me I’m not chucking this
effort directly into a Null Vortex — and this page in particular is not
one that would reward repeat visits. So like. Who will know? Why
bother?</p>
<p>My <a href="/2024/07/22/ai">last post</a> asked this question too,
and didn’t really have a satisfying answer. It was like: maybe I’m
contributing in some minute measure to the much-vaunted (in some
circles) “<a href="https://smallweb.page/home">small web</a>?” I guess?
But that’s not really why I did the work I did (and it was work) over
the weekend. And I want a better answer about what’s motivating me these
days. So I’m going to dump some thoughts into a list.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Okay so I read <a
href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/how-to-do-nothing-resisting-the-attention-economy-jenny-odell/8076119"><em>How
to Do Nothing</em></a> by Jenny Odell recently so I just sort of had
doing nothing on the brain. Updating my web page was not <em>doing
nothing</em> doing nothing, but it is doing a kind of nothing in the
sense that I understand Odell to mean it: no one is making any money off
my web page (notwithstanding the infinitesimal value it’s surely
providing to AI scrapers, but I’m trying to be positive for once in my
life here) and in its own small way it sits in opposition to the
“attention economy” if only because probably no one is paying any
attention to it. So there was just kind of fertile psychological ground
for doing some like… tilling? I don’t know, I’m not a gardener, but you
get what I mean.</p></li>
<li><p>Alright. I lied when I said <em>no one</em> is paying attention
to my web page. But how do I even know? Well, what happened was someone
boosted <a href="https://kayserifserif.place/">Katherine Yang</a>’s <a
href="https://sunny.garden/@kayserifserif/114268711259377892">Mastodon
post</a> about her <a href="https://tree.kayserifserif.place/">In The
Year of a Tree</a> into my timeline and I was like: Hey that looks like
my thing! (It’s not <em>my thing</em> really, Katherine started hers
first and even if she didn’t I got the idea from a book, but like,
<em>this instance</em> of it that I did is mine) And so I replied to it
like: Hey I love this! It’s like my thing but better!<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote"><em>In the Year of a Tree</em> is, objectively, better.
The pictures are better, the presentation is better, the tree changes
more interestingly than my evergreens. But I’m actually really happy
with mine for what it is, which is a document of time well spent doing
nothing. The fixity of the evergreens helps convey the full extent of
the nothing I’m doing. The fact that the pictures are kind of shitty
makes it more about the repetition and the practice than the aesthetics.
I like that <em>In the Year of a Tree</em> has the same ugly rooftop in
every picture. It’s aesthetically interesting to have the hard lines
against the lush or spindly organics of the tree, but it also conveys a
similarly approachable sense of just working with what’s there rather
than being too fussy or artsy about it. Letting the tree do the
talking.<br />
<br />
</span></span> And she replied like “lovely!” and said enough more
specific stuff that I can confidently say that at least <em>one</em>
person has paid attention to my web page, at least once.</p>
<p>I’m trying not to edit this post a lot but I did write and then
delete a mediocre joke about, like, “attention economy, here I come!”
before I thought: No, actually, this is a real thing. Having made this
little project and put it on my web site did really enable this sweet
moment of connection with a total stranger about a similar non-effortful
effort we made to observe and appreciate and maybe see a little more or
deeply at least <em>different</em> than we might in the attention
economy that Jenny Odell would have us resist.</p></li>
<li><p>And so but then shortly after that I got an email out of the blue
from someone appreciating my Sit Spot page, and I’m kind of reluctant to
mention this one but I found their blog and read some of it and sent
them an email back about some of the stuff on it and never got a reply,
and it was kind of like a <em>different</em> email I got a while back
from someone claiming to have been following my (very sporadic and also
largely disregarded) <a href="/studio">music</a> for a long time and
expressing appreciation for a particular old song of mine, and I replied
enthusiastically and never heard back from <em>them</em> either, and so
in both cases I was like: Was this even real? Is someone running a bot
that like finds people’s websites and AI-generates nice emails to send
them? Because that’s sort of a nice idea but also kind of shitty in
execution if the person is looking for an actual connection with a
human, and in both cases I felt like kind of a dupe for actually
replying in the hopes of getting that, so it’s weird and embarrassing
and vulnerable to even include this, but I can’t deny that it did
contribute to my wanting to give my web page a little love.</p></li>
<li><p>I really haven’t been posting here a lot in, like, the last
several years. Part of it is that I always feel like a blog post has to
be a big production for whatever reason. Small things I can just throw
on Mastodon, which doesn’t generally feel shitty to use, even though it
<em>does</em> have that gross attention-economy social-media little
engagement dopamine hit thing going on, but at least that does mean that
my posts are actually reaching other humans. But it’s all so
<em>transient</em>. I can go back and read my feed, and sometimes I do
because I think I’m funny, and that’s fine. But my web site feels like
an <em>edifice</em>, you know? I’ve been updating it, even if only at a
glacial pace at times, for over a decade. It means that at this point I
feel like additions to it need to be <em>worthy</em> of inclusion, even
though some of <a href="/2013/08/06/Python_Cuddles">my earliest
posts</a> are really just unnecessarily verbose Mastodon toots. But so
as a whole, I’m proud of it, and I want to make more blog posts to
contribute to the edifice, but it always seems like so much
<em>work</em>, and do I actually even have anything worth putting that
much effort into saying? If I have an idea for a little improvement to a
random buried page that I know one or possibly even two people have
looked at, even if they don’t look at it again, it’s still a way to kind
of keep in touch with my website. Like, hey bud. I know I haven’t done a
real post in a while. But I still care about you.</p></li>
<li><p>At work I do Professional Software Developer shit. Unit,
functional, integration AND end-to-end tests. Minimum Viable Products.
“Built on AWS.” Observability. Scalability. I get why it’s all important
for trying to do a thing that a lot of people depend on in some way. And
it’s kind of interesting, in its own way. But a cursory look at my
personal programming projects is enough to see it’s not the scale that I
would choose to work at, if I could do whatever I wanted. It doesn’t
feel to me like <em>play</em>, which, I mean, fair enough, it’s work,
but I did get into this profession in 2013 or whatever because I thought
this could be fun. I don’t think what I do for work now is fun, mostly.
But hand-coding a website and the tool I use to build it, with no
stakes? That’s still fun. Maybe it’s a kind of nostalgia, which I’m
deeply suspicious of but susceptible to nonetheless. Or maybe it really
is just all about the fact that there’s no pressure, no one asking
anything of me, just me taking a thing that’s mine and making it a
little better.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Immediate follow-up question, which you may not be asking but which I
want to try to answer regardless: why post about it? When I’m so
confident that if anyone ever actually reads my site I’ll never know
about it?</p>
<p>Well, a couple days after the tweaks I just finished exhaustively
cataloguing my motivations for, I came across this <a
href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/28-slightly-rude-notes-on-writing">wonderful
essay</a> about writing and it made me miss writing prose like I write
code for my website: not really for anyone (but it’s cool if someone
sees it and lets me know somehow), certainly not because anything
<em>depends</em> on it, but just… I don’t know, exactly. For some of the
reasons articulated in that essay, like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing is a costly signal of caring about something.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, perhaps, if I wanted to make this a sort of sequel to my <a
href="/2024/07/22/ai">last blog post</a>, over nine months ago,
because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It used to be that our only competitors were made of carbon. Now some
of our competitors are made out of silicon. New competition should make
us better at competing—this is our chance to be more thoughtful about
writing than we’ve ever been before. No system can optimize for
everything, so what are our minds optimized for, and how can I double
down on <em>that</em>? How can I go even deeper into the territory where
the machines fear to tread, territories that I only notice
<em>because</em> they’re treacherous for machines?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what is it that I want to expensively signal that I care about?
What is it I hope to double down on? The word that keeps bobbing to the
surface of my brain, even after I push it down to see if I can make room
for anything else to float up, is <em>interiority</em>: I have it, my
new silicon competitors do not, I want to double down on it, <a
href="https://news.fsu.edu/news/science-technology/2025/02/17/why-does-chatgpt-delve-so-much-fsu-researchers-begin-to-uncover-why-chatgpt-overuses-certain-words/">delve</a>
deeper into it, make an effort to account for my own human inclinations
and desires. I don’t know if this is “where the machines fear to tread”
or if I’m being “more thoughtful about writing than… ever before” but it
feels intuitively like a promising direction.</p>
<p>I can’t not undermine my own supposed insights or imagine being read
by my worst critic, so let me just say: I don’t really think there’s
anything <em>revolutionary</em> or <em>groundbreaking</em> about the
concept of “<a
href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/01/the-linux-of-social-media-how-livejournal-pioneered-then-lost-web-blogging/">journaling
in public</a>.” But in 2025 it feels like something worth re-affirming
the value of, even if only to myself.</p>
