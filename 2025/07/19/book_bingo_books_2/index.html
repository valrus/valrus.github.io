class="level2">
<h2>Michael Zapata, <em>The Lost Book of Adana Moreau</em></h2>
<p>For the “Suggested by a library worker” square.</p>
<p>Readable but didn’t grab me. Stories and stories and stories—in
addition to the titular book that drives much of the novel’s main
narrative, nearly every character with whom we spend any time gets a
chance to tell a pivotal story in their own personal history to the tune
of a few pages or more. The individual stories, including the
overarching one, are compelling enough but the book didn’t really cohere
that well for me. The book’s tone is one of magical realism, the
matter-of-fact prose of a Gabriel García Márquez but with events that
feel sometimes larger than life but hardly supernatural. There is a lot
of talk about parallel universes but aside from various characters
musing on the concept it didn’t seem integrated into the actual plot in
a way that landed. So my overall experience was a bit disjointed and not
terribly satisfying.</p>

<section id="letters-of-note-grief-compiled-by-shaun-usher"
class="level2">
<h2><em>Letters of Note: Grief</em>, compiled by Shaun Usher</h2>
<p>For the “Grief” bingo square.</p>
<p>A collection of letters on the subject of grief. An interesting
collection of perspectives, but I expected it to be more moving than it
often was. Too many sixteenth- through eighteenth-century dudes telling
people they should actually be happy their loved ones are with God or
whatever, or that grief is pointless or indulgent. And many others
written from people themselves in the throes of grief, some seeming to
try to hold it at arm’s length in that prim Victorian way, some—maybe
too few—really just giving into it. If this collection is trying to
include a lot of different perspectives, I think it would benefit from
more material from outside the U.S. and Europe. If it’s trying to be
moving, I think prospective readers should listen to <em>A Crow Looked
At Me</em> instead.</p>
</section>
<section id="anastacia-reneé-side-notes-from-the-archivist"
class="level2">
<h2>Anastacia-Reneé, <em>Side Notes from the Archivist</em></h2>
<p>For the “New-to-you format” square.</p>
<p>I think this was the worst square on the bingo card, but I tried to
take it seriously. I don’t read a lot of poetry and I’m not good at it,
and <em>Side Notes from the Archivist</em> is not just poetry but poetry
with unorthodox formatting. So all in all it was a pretty new experience
for me. But because I don’t read a lot of poetry and I’m not good at it,
I’m not sure how to talk about it. The kaleidoscopic multiplicity of
styles and themes (year-stamped snapshots from the 80s, an imaginary TV
show about a black girl, Aunt Jemima as <a
href="/2022/08/02/In_The_Dream_House/">Dream House</a>, thin columns of
trisyllabic lines and blocks of prose poetry, lists and statistics and
parenthesized words and elided words and expanses of blank space) maybe
make this a challenging read even for people more accustomed to poetry
than I am. The jumble of the collage on the book’s cover feels
appropriate to the content. But I do think the stylistic experimentation
is effective: it conveys the explosion of thoughts and experiences that
come with being a Black queer person in the U.S. And throughout, there’s
a very compelling rhythm to the words. I often found myself hearing the
voice and cadence of <a
href="https://moormother.bandcamp.com/music">Moor Mother</a> in my head
while reading it. As a collection it’s a bit bewildering but it rarely
seems indulgent; the disorientation feels appropriate to the emotional
landscape being mapped out.</p>
</section>
<section id="chris-abani-smoking-the-bible" class="level2">
<h2>Chris Abani, <em>Smoking the Bible</em></h2>
<p>For the “<a href="https://lectures.org/">SAL Speaker</a> (Past or
Present)” square.</p>
<p>Another book of poetry! This one is far more sedate than <em>Side
Notes from the Archivist</em>, more meditative, less experimental by
far. I’m gonna say some things that reflect more on me as a reader than
on <em>Smoking the Bible</em> itself, but what the hell, it’s my blog,
not a professional book review.</p>
<p>I have some self-judgment about how I read. Reading a lot of trashy
fantasy and sci-fi novels in middle and high school taught me how to
read very fast, with not a lot of deep understanding because it wasn’t
really necessary for those books. But I think this hurt me when I had to
read math textbooks and shit in college, and like math textbooks, I
don’t think you can effectively read poetry this way. In some senses
<em>Side Notes from the Archivist</em> was easier on me: the formal
experimentation felt like it allowed me to be OK with not fully
understanding. <em>Smoking the Bible</em> reads more like (what I have
been taught to think of as) Literature, so I had a familiar feeling that
I was just not really picking up what the author was putting down.</p>
<p>But even if I didn’t get every reference and allusion and metaphor,
or even what every poem was “about” in a broad sense, this was a
beautiful and lyrical collection of poems. I read a few of them aloud to
myself at my <a href="/outside/sit-spot.html">sit spot</a> and it didn’t
help me understand the meaning because I was too busy savoring the
texture of the words.</p>
<p>Some of these poems—about a dying brother—are better meditations on
grief than much of anything in the <em>Letters of Note</em> book
reviewed above. There’s not a narrative from start to finish so much as
a sketched-out arc, sweeping gracefully from a sort of invocation of a
Muse and a terminal diagnosis to some vivid, hard-to-read imagery of new
death and what seems like some kind of peace. Along the way: an abusive
father, smells of cooking, peregrination. Trying to write about this
book, I feel like maybe I should read it again.</p>
