    <h1><em>One Of Our Kind</em> by Nicola Yoon</h1>
    
    <subtitle>SPL Book Bingo 2025, Book 9: Dystopia</subtitle>
    
    <p>I’m doing this out of order and skipping books 7 and 8 for now,
because I just finished this one and wanted to get my thoughts down
while they’re swirling around.</p>
<p><em>Note: This post will contain spoilers for</em> One Of Our
Kind.</p>
<p>My knee-jerk reaction upon finishing this novel was to give it 5
stars and call it a day. For me it was fantastically successful in what
it seemed to be going for. I’ve seen it referred to as a thriller, but
to me it really read like a horror story, in much the same way I thought
that <a href="/2022/08/02/In_The_Dream_House"><em>In the Dream
House</em></a> was a horror story. All the plot’s beats seemed like
those of a horror story: main character moves to a new place, something
seems wrong but she can’t put her finger on it, repeated hints of
something sinister going on, escalating uncanny dread and terror. I
found it riveting and finished it in three days.</p>
<p>I think when I read a book as fast as I read <em>One Of Our
Kind</em>, it can make me overlook some of its flaws, so I went looking
for reviews and was surprised to see a lot of Black people on Goodreads
tearing it apart. Though I disagreed with a lot of it, sometimes
strongly, enough of the criticism did land with me that I would
ultimately call this a four-star book.</p>
<p>Some of the things that were criticised, sharply at times, did seem
to me like misreadings. Some people accused the ending of being
anti-Black and essentially saying “it’s better to be white,” but it felt
very clear to me that, this being a horror story and a tragedy, the bad
guys win, and the ending needs to be read in that light. I don’t see the
character in the epilogue as being content with her life. I see her as
disconnected from her humanity and even from her own son.</p>
<p>A lot of the criticism also seemed to assume that the main character
Jasmyn is a mouthpiece for the author, and we’re supposed to agree with
her even as she criticizes other Black people for straightening their
hair or opting out of demonstrating in response to police violence. I
saw Jasmyn as sympathetic but hardly flawless, and I think she was
written that way on purpose.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">An <a
href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/09/nx-s1-83383/nicola-yoon-on-her-novel-one-of-our-kind-and-trauma-in-black-american-life">interview
with the author</a> confirms this was, at least, the intention.<br />
<br />
</span></span> I think a lot of people feel the pressure of the world
having too many problems to be able to feel like taking time out is
justified, and it’s easy for self-judgment about not doing enough to
manifest as judgment of others. And I think that Jasmyn’s classically
bad-horror-movie decisions at the end of the book can be seen as a
consequence of her running herself ragged in the preceding months. She’s
not a paragon and it seemed to me that we’re supposed to see where she’s
coming from but not necessarily agree with or even like her.</p>
<p>For that matter, the villains in this book aren’t wholly
unsympathetic, which I found to be pretty deft characterization since
their actions are abhorrent. Racist circumstances have put them in what
feels like a no-win situation, and they go to extremes to try to find a
way out of it. The conclusions are appalling but the route to get there
was not unrealistic to me. (Questions of whether the end of the book is
like <em>scientifically plausible</em> seem completely beside the
point.)</p>
<p>But there were some criticims that landed with me. Having Jasmyn as
our POV character does make being Black in America seem like pretty much
just unremitting bleakness. Part of that probably comes from the
author’s acknowledgment that she wrote <em>One Of Our Kind</em> “from a
place of despair and anger” and that comes through in both the tone and
the outcome of the plot. The bleakness seems pretty consistent with the
situation that Jasmyn is in, where being unable to get any traction with
her fellow Liberty residents about the things that are important to her,
she responds by leaning into them even harder to the point where they
become all-encompassing. I think it makes sense in context, but it does
mean that despite Jasmyn and her few friends occasionally talking a big
game about Black joy, there’s very little of it to be found in the
events of the book.</p>
<p>Another consequence of Jasmyn’s single-mindedness is that all the
characters come off as being somewhat shallow. Jasmyn is laser-focused
on social justice and the lack thereof in Liberty, and she ends up not
really having a personality outside of that. And because our view on all
the other characters is filtered through Jasmyn, who can’t get past how
they’re failing to live up to her standards, they all seem pretty
paper-thin as well. Again, I think this is a pretty natural consequence
of how the story is told. But it does mean there’s not a lot of room for
nuance.</p>
<p>“Not a lot of room for nuance” is actually a pretty good summary of
this book, for better and worse. There’s no room for nuance because the
book does such a potent job of conveying how the anxiety induced by
living in a deeply racist society can be smothering, suffocating.
Sometimes it’s overly didactic and a bit clunky about this, and it’s
rarely anything resembling subtle. But I think there’s a place for books
that tell a story about that anxiety, and how it can fuck people up, in
an unsubtle and uncomfortable way.</p>
