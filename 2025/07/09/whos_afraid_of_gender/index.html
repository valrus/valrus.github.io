    <h1><em>Who's Afraid of Gender?</em> by Judith Butler</h1>
    
    <subtitle>SPL Book Bingo 2025, Book 7: Gender Bender</subtitle>
    
    <p>Well, asked and answered: who’s afraid of gender? The answer may not
surprise you: it’s all the worst people in the fucking world! To help us
understand why, sort of, Judith Butler takes us on a journey that I
found to be equal parts mind-expanding, boring, and perplexing, along
the way using some variation of the word “phantasmatic” about two
thousand times.</p>
<p>“Phantasmatic” is the word that Butler uses to describe the weird,
nebulous, rarely consistent but always threatening cluster of
associations that fascists, TERFs (but I repeat myself) and regressive
close-minded assholes the world over spray in a perpetual miasmic haze
around the concept of “gender” to make credulous nitwits think that it,
rather than, say, sociopathic billionaires, is responsible for the many
problems in the world today. Book reviews should be written from a
viewpoint. I trust I have made my position on so-called
“gender-critical” ideology clear: it’s not because I <em>disagree</em>
with Butler that I found <em>Who’s Afraid of Gender?</em> to be kind of
a struggle to get through.</p>
<p>Here is a ranking of the main things covered in <em>Who’s Afraid of
Gender?</em> in increasing order of how much I liked reading them:</p>
<ol reversed>
<li>
<strong>Heavily theory-inflected explorations of gender and sex</strong>
that I didn’t really understand
</li>
<li>
<strong>Lists of bullshit beliefs held and actions undertaken by
aforementioned “gender-critical” numpties</strong>, who are not actually
“critical” in the sense of making any honest effort to understand or
thoughtfully engage with gender, and therefore think and act only in
exceedingly boring, stupid ways about it
</li>
<li>
<strong>Investigations of the inner workings of what passes for
gender-critical thought</strong> that seemed largely speculative and
were pretty uninteresting regardless, since that so-called “thought”
seems to be mostly a mishmash of unexamined stereotypes, religious or
other superstition, “science” as understood by a third-grader and simple
rank bigotry fueled by fear of difference
</li>
<li>
<strong>Gender-critical bigot DESTROYED with FACTS and LOGIC</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Heavily theory-inflected explorations of gender and sex</strong>
that I did understand, at least somewhat, and that got me thinking about
them, and intersectionality, and language, and other topics in a new way
</li>
</ol>
<p>The book mainly seemed unfocused and I had no idea who its audience
was. Obviously no one gender-critical would be convinced by it, not
least because they are allergic to complexity and nuance and the
theoretical stuff would cause them to throw up their hands and say “Why
do you have to make it so COMPLICATED when any THIRD GRADER knows the
difference between MEN and WOMEN???” and then probably go and call the
cops on a cis woman with a pixie cut in the ladies’ room or whatever
they do in their free time. But on the other hand, I think most
sympathetic readers would be bored by the belaboring of all the ways
that gender is under attack worldwide. I know about a lot of this, and
what I didn’t already know wasn’t surprising or interesting.</p>
<p>But let me be serious for a bit and also mention some of the things
that were surprising or interesting or thought-provoking to me, a
sympathetic reader who is not well-versed in the theory and history of
gender. Often they were obvious in retrospect but just not things I’d
thought about.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Sex” is often thought of as “biology,” dichotomous and cleanly
separated from “gender” which is a cultural construct sort of layered on
top of it. But even when a child is “sexed” at birth through inspection
of their body, that declaration brings along a whole host of assumptions
about what that sex <em>means</em> in the surrounding culture. Butler
argues for thinking of the relation between sex and gender as
“co-construction.” I found this compelling in how it accounts for the
complex interplay between “biology” and “culture,” but it was complex
and I can’t claim to have understood it well enough to be very
effectively summarizing it here.</li>
<li>When so-called conservatives claim to be defending “the family,” of
they are of course shunting aside any modern-day conceptualization of
the family that doesn’t fit into their narrow nuclear-family vision. But
that vision also comes from a tradition that achieved dominance by
steamrolling over plenty of historical alternatives all around the
world.</li>
<li>The same goes for the gender binary, which conservative forces will
insist is to be defended against the encroachment of Western gender
ideology; in fact, the binary itself is a construct of colonial empires
imposed on the colonized people, squashing whatever other conception of
gender they might have had previously.</li>
<li>Financial aid, to “third-world” countries that require financial aid
due to the depredations of the “first world,” is often contingent on
those countries being tolerant of e.g. homosexuality. But this positions
that tolerance as a colonial imposition. This is a compelling angle on
intersectionality: one can’t effectively support the right to sexual
self-expression without also opposing colonialism.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last few chapters of <em>Who’s Afraid of Gender,</em> which take
this more expansive look at what “gender” means to people around the
world in the larger geopolitical context of colonization and
imperialism, were some of the most compelling and provocative. As
someone with an interest in linguistics and where language fails, I was
pretty fascinated by the chapter about translation and how the
assumption of monolingualism in English discussions of gender does act
as a sort of colonial force: it effaces conceptualizations of “gender”
in other countries that fall outside the hegemonic binary but don’t
translate cleanly to English terms such as “transgender” or
“intersex.”</p>
<p>I read <em>Who’s Afraid of Gender?</em> pretty slowly over the course
of about a month. Ultimately I wish I’d distributed that time more
unevenly, skimming over the parts about how gender is under attack by
regressives and bigots and paying a lot closer and more careful
attention to the theoretical explorations of what gender <em>means</em>
in different contexts. Some of those explorations were hard for me to
follow but they were also where Judith Butler had the most intriguing
things to say.</p>
