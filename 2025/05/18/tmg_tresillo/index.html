    <h1>
        "The Mountain Goats Rhythm" is called a Tresillo
    </h1>
    
    <p>Today I learned that the rhythm that I have just thought of as “the
Mountain Goats rhythm,” the one that goes
“ONE-two-three-ONE-two-three-ONE-two,” is actually called a “<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tresillo_(rhythm)">tresillo</a>.” I
was going to dash off a quick post about it, but a Web search for
“mountain goats tresillo” didn’t turn up anything obvious so I ended up
feeling like I needed to write The Definitive Reference On The Matter.
In the interest of curbing my own obsessive tendencies I have tried to
land somewhere short of that.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">Update as I put the finishing touches on the last
paragraph of this post: I failed.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>I learned about the tresillo from this interesing video which has
absolutely nothing to do with the Mountain Goats:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ81jzlR1y4"><img
src="/assets/images/posts/Tresillo/video_cap.jpg"
alt="A comparison of the paradiddle and tresillo rhythms, showing a measure broken into eight eighth notes. A tresillo has emphasis on beats 1, 4 and 7." /></a></p>
<p>I should not have been surprised that it has a name; it’s not exactly
uncommon. And obviously the Mountain Goats did not <em>invent</em> this
rhythm. But I think of it as “the Mountain Goats rhythm” because for
like the first decade of the band’s existence it seems like John
Darnielle’s go-to acoustic guitar strumming pattern: once I noticed it I
started hearing it <em>everywhere</em> in the early songs. It’s
especially all over what wannabe music reviewers like myself would call
tMG’s “propulsive” songs, but there are plenty of other songs featuring
it too: it’s there on “<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKGPIji1uN4">Going to
Georgia</a>,” maybe the “band’s” first certifiable “hit.” “<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HILnK3lf5a8">Sinaloan Milk Snake
Song</a>.” “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmdEKZvIAJ0">Going
to Lebanon</a>.” “<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mu_Ec-2XIg">Down Here</a>.” <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z48WS_iHuxg">“Sept 16 Triple X
Love! Love!”</a> “<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBXcnYYxsTQ">Send Me An
Angel</a>.” “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t_3LKJ9DRc">Prana
Ferox</a>.” “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKjmtO1R1HE">Alpha
Double Negative: Going to Catalina</a>.” “<a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/track/elijah">Elijah</a>.”
“<a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/track/baboon">Baboon</a>.” I
could go on. Maybe I will. How about super old shit like “<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvjtCoKRLZU">Beach House</a>?”
<em>Really</em> super old shit like “<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCR6DTbcpik">Going to Alaska</a>?”
Random compilation tracks like “<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ghPnm8_Kik">Please Come Home To
Hamngatan</a>?” Joke songs like “<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVHb-fcmPrk">Anti-Music Song</a>?”
Collaborations like <a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/track/surrounded">“Surrounded”,</a>
from that <a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/album/moon-colony-bloodbath">John
Vanderslice split EP thing</a>? Every <em>other</em> measure, give or
take, of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWYUKDspBgo">Night of
the Mules</a>?” And, of course, there’s “<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moyOBZWENEo">Two Thousand
Seasons</a>.”<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">Just seeing if you were still paying attention with
that one.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>It’s more frequently modified later in the boombox era (or maybe
obscured by the other instruments Darnielle was starting to add in) but
it’s still there: in “<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etlSqMXlwrM">Then the Letting
Go</a>,” in “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tas2wZO79RE">New
Britain</a>,” in “<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoWvMQpCBMc">Minnesota</a>,” in
“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIWsdBInhY8">Chinese House
Flowers</a>” (which again slips back into the straight-up tresillo strum
in the chorus). “<a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/track/the-alphonse-mambo">The
Alphonse Mambo</a>,” under the harmonica and… pump organ?. In “<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9HSgfv_RnA">Full Flower</a>” both
an acoustic <em>and</em> distorted guitar play it… a first? Probably, if
only because in the re-recording of <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVQMid_HowM">“Going to Kansas”</a>
later on <em>Nothing for Juice</em>, the electric does other stuff. In
“<a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/track/cao-dai-blowout">Cao
Dai Blowout</a>” and subtly in “<a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/track/the-last-limit-of-bhakti">The
Last Limit of Bhakti</a>,” now with banjo. In “<a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/track/yoga">Yoga</a>,” now
in electric guitar <em>and</em> with <em>violin</em>.</p>
<p>Even on songs where Darnielle doesn’t <em>strum</em> a tresillo, it
pops up: see the “bass” notes in “<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3cHwrZGl0Y">We Have Seen The
Enemy</a>” and “<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpZS6U89QnI">Seed Song</a>.”
Granted, the Mountain Goats have like 600 songs, but still: I rest my
case. Maybe the lyric in “<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdY7aDVYAJs">You Were Cool</a>”
should have been “This is a song with the same strumming pattern I use
most of the time / When I’ve got something on my mind / And I don’t want
to squander the moment.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I do feel the need for one more chunk of evidence. <a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/album/heretic-pride"><em>Heretic
Pride</em></a>, when the band got a real full-time drummer in Jon
Wurster, is sort of the extinction burst of the tresillo in tMG
music<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote"><a
href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11181-heretic-pride/">Pitchfork’s
review</a> alludes to JD’s use of the tresillo in describing Wurster’s
playing: “Of all the musicians that have come and gone in the 4AD era,
Superchunk’s Jon Wurster is—Peter Hughes aside—the first to hear, and
replicate, the precise, surging, and teeth-chattering headlong rhythm
that is Darnielle’s stock-in-trade.” And, of course, later on it refers
to three of the album’s livelier songs, two of which feature the
tresillo, as “propulsive.”<br />
<br />
</span></span>. It’s incredibly clear and obvious in five of its 13
songs: lead single “<a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/track/sax-rohmer-1">Sax
Rohmer #1</a>,” <a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/track/heretic-pride">the
title track</a>, “<a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/track/autoclave">Autoclave</a>,”
“<a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/track/in-the-craters-on-the-moon">In
the Craters on the Moon</a>,” and “<a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/track/how-to-embrace-a-swamp-creature">How
to Embrace a Swamp Creature</a>.”</p>
<p>I tend to assume that when Wurster joined the band he pushed
Darnielle away from his main rhythmic go-to— or just freed him up from
having to do something passing for a drumbeat on an acoustic guitar— but
in truth I was thinking the tresillo was on its way out starting at
around <em>All Hail West Texas</em>, the last album of the Mountain
Goats’ “boombox era.” That album really only has “<a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/track/distant-stations">Distant
Stations</a>,” and the same year’s studio album <a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/album/tallahassee"><em>Tallahassee</em></a>
doesn’t really have There’s just “<a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/track/woke-up-new">Woke Up
New</a>” on the uncharacteristically slow and somber <a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/album/get-lonely"><em>Get
Lonely</em></a>. Oops, there’s also “<a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/track/cobra-tattoo">Cobra
Tattoo</a>.” And “<a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/track/moon-over-goldsboro">Moon
Over Goldsboro</a>,” and uh there it is between the arpeggios on <a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/track/get-lonely">the title
track</a>. OK, and so I was going to say “but there aren’t any on
<em>The Sunset Tree</em> really” but then I listened back again and… oh,
right. there it is front and center in “<a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/track/up-the-wolves">Up the
Wolves</a>,” possibly one of the top 5 iconic Mountain Goats songs,
certainly top 10. And why not? By this point JD was Bruce Lee’s man
who’s practiced one kick 10,000 times.</p>
<p>Okay, so maybe <em>Heretic Pride</em> really <em>was</em> an
extinction burst and Wurster was the death knell, because tresillos are
<em>actually</em> very thin on the ground in recent tMG music. There’s
exactly one on its follow-up, <a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/album/the-life-of-the-world-to-come"><em>The
Life of the World to Come</em></a>, in what could be called its
old-school Mountain Goats banger “<a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/track/psalms-40-2">Psalms
40:2</a>,” and a couple tucked away near the end of <a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/album/songs-for-pierre-chuvin"><em>Songs
for Pierre Chuvin</em></a>, the resurrected-boombox album John Darnielle
made in the thick of the pandemic. There’s the ghost of one in Wurster’s
drums on “<a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/track/harbor-me">Harbor
Me</a>.” But I don’t really <em>expect</em> to hear John strumming away
in that old familiar ONE-two-three-ONE-two-three-ONE-two anymore. Even
<a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/album/bleed-out"><em>Bleed
Out</em></a>, the liveliest front-to-back tMG album since <em>Heretic
Pride</em>, just has that bassline in “<a
href="https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/track/extraction-point">Extraction
Point</a>.”</p>
<p>I don’t have a conclusion to this post because the only point of it
was to comment on John Darnielle’s use of the tresillo rhythm and how
it’s trended over the years, and I think I’ve done that. But if you’re a
Mountain Goats fan, why not send me an email or hit me up on Mastodon to
tell me if you noticed the tresillo and if so, whether you knew it was
called that? (Or tell me I’m totally off base and my examples are all
cherry-picked, whatever. Just don’t be mean to me.)</p>
