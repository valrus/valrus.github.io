    <h1><em>Ducks, Newburyport</em></h1>
    
    <p>I didn’t finish my Book Bingo posts — and maybe I will sometime but
maybe I won’t — but participating in Book Bingo got me back in the habit
of reading instead of aimlessly browsing the internet, at least
<em>some</em> of the time. So I may continue writing about the
occasional book.</p>
<p>Confession time: even though David Foster Wallace turned out to be a
real piece of shit in a lot of ways, I still love <em>Infinite
Jest</em>. My excuse is I read it when I was 20, possibly the ideal age
for having your mind absolutely blown by a big, indulgently maximalist
novel that’s equal parts sincere and irreverent, serious and playful.
But the book has also become shorthand for a kind of “lit-bro” mindset
that I feel defensive about whenever I mention it. In a way, I’m looking
for a new favorite book, and ideally one with less baggage (between its
covers and in the minds of people I might mention it to) than
<em>Infinite Jest</em> has. I’m not 20 anymore so it’s unlikely that any
present-day reading will have the effect on me that <em>Infinite
Jest</em> did. But the search is a good excuse to read daunting,
idiosyncratic, ambitious novels.</p>
<p><em>Ducks, Newburyport</em> is one such book. It’s not, I think, my
new favorite. But it’s almost completely unlike anything I’ve ever read,
and it made me think a lot of thoughts.</p>
<p>Let me start with a run-down of the superficial, attention-getting
characteristics of <em>Ducks, Newburyport</em> that you’ll probably
encounter immediately if you look up anything about it on the internet:
It’s almost a thousand pages long<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">A lightly bowdlerized and editorialized glossary of
abbreviations (“POS” and “POTUS” are rendered as “Piece of [Scat]” and
“Purveyor of Totally Unprecedented Sleaze,” respectively) pushes the
length over 1,000 pages.<br />
<br />
</span></span> and almost all of those pages consist of the interior
monologue of an Ohio housewife which is punctuated by the phrase “the
fact that” in lieu of any full stops besides the one on page 988.</p>
<p>The stream of consciousness is occasionally, and relatively briefly,
broken up by more conventional prose describing the journey of a
mountain lion through the unnamed narrator’s environs. The purposeful
terseness of these sections stands in stark contrast to the
anxiety-ridden torrent of the main narrative, in the nine hundred or so
pages of which (as noted by an excellent <a
href="https://www.cageclub.me/ducks-newburyport-lucy-ellmann/">podcast
episode</a> about the book) about four things happen.</p>
<p>It’s hard to read a book like <em>Ducks, Newburyport</em> without
either giving up a hundred pages in or starting to ask yourself
questions like <em>What is this book trying to do?</em> and <em>What’s
the point of the unusual structure of this thing?</em> and, like,
<em>What even is a novel, anyway, man?</em> And though I opened this
post with <em>Infinite Jest</em> because I think <em>Ducks,
Newburyport</em>’s heft necessarily invites comparison to other hefty,
maximalist novels, I hesitate to call <em>Ducks</em> maximalist just
because it is actually very stylistically homogenous. It’s just big. But
there’s a subversiveness and an audacity in spending <em>so much
time</em> in the thoughts of this one everywoman as she struggles with
the quotidian stresses of raising children and baking tarts and
psychologically coping with being an American woman in the late
twenty-teens. It suggests that with enough attention, any person can be
an epic hero whose struggles warrant a weighty doorstopper of a tome.
But, aside from <em>Ducks</em>, we don’t often get a chance to read such
a book.</p>
<p>I am not good at spotting and analyzing literary devices, so if
<em>Ducks, Newburyport</em> employs any subtle ones, I didn’t pick up on
them. But the naturally cyclic, obsessive thought patterns of the
anxious person (to which I am no stranger) introduce a natural
continuity and some thematic through-lines to a story that might
otherwise be unreadably shapeless.</p>
<p>So: <em>Ducks, Newburyport</em> is engaging despite its narrative not
really having an “arc”. Its flouting of conventions makes it what it is,
and the mountain lion sections, effective as they are as a foil for the
primary narrative, do feel like a bit of a concession to the artifice
that’s the water most novels swim in.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote"><em>Ducks, Newburyport</em> is all artifice too, of
course. It purports to be the inner monologue of a person who’s not the
author; how could it not be? But one of its greatest achievements is
that it doesn’t <em>feel</em> like it is.<br />
<br />
</span></span> All this may be why the conclusion of the novel was kind
of a weird letdown, despite pulling together a lot of threads in an
actually very narratively satisfying way. My initial reaction was: Hell
yeah! The payoff, at last! But then later, the fact that there
<em>was</em> a payoff started to feel incongruous with the rest of the
book.</p>
<p>When evaluating how “believable” a work of fiction is, I tend to
stick to a sort of analogue of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle">anthropic
principle</a>. Sure, the events in a story may be improbable. But for
many stories, that very improbability is why the story is remarkable,
and thus, why it’s being told in the first place. Until its last hundred
pages, though, <em>Ducks, Newburyport</em> makes something truly
<em>novel</em>, no pun intended, out of events that don’t feel
meticulously and purposefully constructed and arranged. For me, the
tidiness of the ending counterproductively reined in the glorious, messy
sprawl of what came before it. In an ordinary novel, it would have been
an unambiguous triumph. The problem is that <em>Ducks, Newburyport</em>
is not an ordinary novel.</p>
