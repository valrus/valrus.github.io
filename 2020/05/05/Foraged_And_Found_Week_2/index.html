        Foraged & Found CSA: Week 2
    </h1>
    
    <p>It’s the weekend after week 2 of the Foraged and Found Edibles CSA,
so time to review what I made with the week’s haul. Since this was the
second week it wasn’t quite as thrilling as the first, and I hadn’t yet
decided to blog the proceedings, so I forgot to take a picture of the
whole spread. I’ll correct this oversight in future installments.</p>
<section id="ramps" class="level2">
<h2>Ramps</h2>
<p><em>Boy</em> were these inconvenient and gross to clean! The CSA
newsletter alluded to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t be intimidated by the dirt. Cleaning is easy once you snap off
the root base; the outer membrane will simply slip off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I definitely should have actually read this beforehand, as I did
those two things in reverse order, but the experience still would have
combined dirt with the sliminess of week-old green onions even had I
done it correctly.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">
<a href="/assets/images/posts/Foraged_And_Found_Week_2/dirty_ramps.jpeg" rel="bytebox">

alt="A bunch of green ramps in a bowl. The root ends are caked in dirt."
src="/assets/images/posts/Foraged_And_Found_Week_2/dirty_ramps_thumb.jpeg"
> </a> </span></p>
<p>Anyway, once we got them cleaned off, we got some mileage out of
these little guys. Some we sautéed with raisins and pine nuts and put
over whipped ricotta on toast, using a recipe from <em><a
href="https://www.joshuamcfadden.com/sixseasons">Six Seasons</a></em> (a
book will probably appear pretty frequently in this blog series) that is
pretty faithfully reproduced <a
href="https://www.acouplecooks.com/agrodolce-scallions-whipped-ricotta-toast/">here</a>.</p>
<p>A few others went into pesto, more on which shortly. The remainder we
dumped into another creamy (but dairy-free) soup whose other main
component was mushrooms.</p>
<p>All these things were tasty enough, but I’m not sure they made the
differences between ramps and the humble green onion clear to me.</p>
</section>
<section id="wild-watercress" class="level2">
<h2>Wild Watercress</h2>
<p>I think we used about a third of this in some compound butter from
<em>Six Seasons</em>. The remainder became another pesto, which is
turning out to be a wonderful dumping ground for green things I’m not
sure what to do with, but which didn’t really let the flavor of the
watercress shine like it did with the fennel fronds from last week. My
approach to pesto is pretty unsubtle, and it may be that I need to
choose the nuts more judiciously or lighten up on the other ingredients
if the greens are less strongly flavored or distinctive than basil or
fennel.</p>
</section>
<section id="saskatoon-jam" class="level2">
<h2>Saskatoon Jam</h2>
<p>This came in a jar and we haven’t used it in any recipes, but it’s
wonderful on bread! The newsletter said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we like to compare the flavor [of a fresh saskatoon] to a mix of
black cherry, chocolate and almond</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and while it’s a nice jam, for sure, I wouldn’t say those flavors all
come through.</p>
</section>
<section id="japanese-knotweed" class="level2">
<h2>Japanese Knotweed</h2>
<p>A weird bamboo-esque thing, unpretty to look at and slightly slimy
when cut. It’s apparently highly invasive but was not very generously
supplied in the CSA — we got only a few stalks. The newsletter compared
it to rhubarb and celery, so I used a <a
href="https://www.cookingclassy.com/strawberry-rhubarb-crumb-bars/">very
easy strawberry-rhubarb crumb bar recipe</a> and made the obvious
substitution. But there was so little of it that my using additional
strawberries to make up the difference resulted in bars that basically
tasted of strawberry. Which was fine, but I could have done that without
having to mess with knotweed.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">

</section>
<section id="brown-beechshimeji-mushroom" class="level2">
<h2>Brown Beech/Shimeji Mushroom</h2>
<p>Appetizing clusters of little mushrooms. I forgot about them for a
week and then dumped them in the soup with the ramps, which was fine but
once again totally obscured any unique flavor they might have had.</p>
</section>
<section id="all-in-all" class="level2">
<h2>All In All</h2>
<p>Not a terribly successful week in terms of appreciating the
uniqueness of these ingredients! I suppose, all things considered, the
agrodolce ramps would be the winners as far as tasting good and letting
the ingredient shine. Unfortunately even that meal was tainted somewhat
by my being a dumbass and eating way too much bread. Will next week be
better? Stay tuned!</p>
