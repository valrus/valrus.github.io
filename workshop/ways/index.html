<h1>What Is This</h1>
<p>To quote <a href="https://lrhodes.net/ways/ways">L. Rhodes</a>, from
whom I got this idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Ways folder is an online resource where an author or group can
store documents for sharing useful ways of doing things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s more musing on how a Ways page might contribute to the social
fabric of a less-commercial internet, and some opinions on how it should
be approached, <a
href="https://destructured.net/practice-ways">here</a>.</p>

<section id="food" class="level1">
<h1>Food</h1>
<section id="oleo-saccharum" class="level2">
<h2>Oleo Saccharum</h2>
<p>If you’ve ever peeled an orange, think of the little spume of mist
that bursts out when you break the peel, and how it smells. In some ways
it’s even “orangier” than the flesh itself. It’s a shame to throw it
away once you’ve eaten the orange. To capture it in a usable form with
minimal effort, peel the orange as shallowly as possible (a Y-peeler
seems best for this, but a regular potato peeler will do) as the white
pith is bitter and has none of the aromatic oil that the surface does.
Pile any number of orange (or any citrus) peels in a bowl and cover them
in sugar. Leave the mess to sit until the oils from the peels have
permeated the sugar and given it a “wet sand” appearance; overnight is
good. (You can also accumulate this mixture in the fridge for a week or
more while you work your way through your citrus, so you don’t have a
bunch of nude oranges lying around making you uncomfortable.) Then add
enough hot water to dissolve the sugar and strain the whole thing into
the container of your choice. The resulting elixir can be used for
beverages or drizzled on baked goods and will keep in the fridge for
longer than it’s ever taken me to use it.</p>
</section>
<section id="shakshuka" class="level2">
<h2>Shakshuka</h2>
<p>I like to vary my cooking to a nearly pathological extent so I don’t
really have “go-to” dishes, but shakshuka is a perfect food. Scales up
easily, tastes just as good on the second or third day. Cheap. Great
year round — use fresh tomatoes if you got ’em, but it’s wonderful with
just canned too. Amenable to improvisation: there’s some spices it
usually has but it needs very little spice and you can mix it up and
still end up with something good. Add feta or another cheese, or don’t.
Add cilantro or parsley or don’t. Goes with bread, goes with pasta, goes
with couscous. Probably would be pretty great over potatoes or rice. And
of course it’s fucking delicious. A perfect food.</p>
</section>
<section id="pesto" class="level2">
<h2>Pesto</h2>
<p>Another perfect food is pesto. Sure, the classic Genovese pesto is a
very specific thing and pine nuts are expensive. But: instead you can
use walnuts. Or sunflower seeds. Or, as appropriate, literally any other
kind of nut. And basil isn’t necessarily good year-round: guess what?
Use parsley. Use carrot greens. Use fennel fronds. Use arugula. Use
cilantro. Use fuckin watercress. Or don’t even use leaves — sun-dried
tomato pesto is a thing too. And of course you have as many options for
cheese as for the other stuff.</p>
<p>You could argue shakshuka is a meal in itself whereas pesto is not,
but really they’re both best over a grain. So: whip up a pound of pasta
and make a pesto sauce in literally one minute. Spread it on some bread.
Or even mix in some sour cream or yogurt and have a dip for crackers or
vegetables! Or don’t and just dip things in it straight! Eat it hot or
cold! Pesto! A perfect food!</p>

<h1>Reusing Things</h1>
<section id="jars" class="level2">
<h2>Jars</h2>
<p>I hate when something comes in a nice jar that I want to use for my
own purposes when I’ve emptied it and there’s a label stuck to it with
adhesive that only comes off in shreds. One trick I’ve found for such
labels is to fill the jar with very hot water first. The heat may soften
the adhesive (I can’t promise anything, I’m sure there are as many kinds
of adhesive as there are kinds of jar) and enable you to peel the label
off more easily. I recently achieved this with some jars from <a
href="https://www.penzeys.com/">Penzey’s Spices</a>, whose labels are
absolutely impossible to remove at room temperature.</p>
