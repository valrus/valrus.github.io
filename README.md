# valrus.github.io

This is the personal web site for Ian McCowan.
It's live at [http://valrus.github.io](http://valrus.github.io)
and [http://ian.mccowan.space](http://ian.mccowan.space).
It's generated using a fork that I created of the [Mynt](http://mynt.uhnomoli.com) static site generator,
and its [source](https://github.com/valrus/small-clever-rooms) is available too.
If you have a problem with the site, feel free to [log a ticket](https://github.com/valrus/small-clever-rooms/issues)!
