    <h1>
        A Different Kind of Freedom February
    </h1>
    
    <p>My employer <a href="https://www.bonanza.com/jobs">Bonanza</a> has an
interesting employee benefit called “Freedom February,” where during
that month every employee gets a week’s worth of free days off and some
cash to offset the cost of using those days to take a tropical vacation
should they desire to do so. Generally, several months in advance,
employees decide on a few specific destinations and those who want to
travel with their co-workers choose one from among them.</p>
<p>As a generally travel- and planning-averse person, I opted for the
easiest destination, and then watched helplessly as it hemorrhaged
people until there were too few to make it worth the while of anyone
still nominally on board to plan. That scheme having fallen through, I
resolved to use February to do some #adulting and take care of some
imposing tasks that I otherwise foresaw myself putting off as long as
possible.</p>
<p>The first of these was doing my taxes, probably earlier in the year
than any time in the last decade. It was boring and this post will not
mention it again.</p>
<p>The second was getting a vasectomy, which I had “wanted” to do ever
since I found out it was a thing but been putting off pretty casually
for probably about ten years and then more aggressively for another five
once I got to a place in my life where it actually seemed like a viable
option. Those last five years started when I got a mandatory
pre-procedure consultation and then balked (and balked, and balked)
purely because of the small-scale practical considerations.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">As opposed to uncertainty or doubt, which I never
experienced in those fifteen years.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>First among these considerations, from one perspective, was the
doctor at that consultation telling me I wouldn’t be able to bike after
the procedure for <em>two to three weeks!</em> Cycling is my primary way
of getting around, and this seemed like just an insurmountably
style-cramping restriction on my mobility: a big enough disruption to my
normal life routine to require significant planning around it. But
during Freedom February, pretty much everyone who didn’t zip off to a
tropical paradise at least works from home for most or all of the month.
So my excuse of having my commute borked was irrelevant.</p>
<p>With that excuse gone, though, I saw the looming procedure from a new
perspective: one from which the previously insurmountable obstacle of
negotiating transportation seemed utterly trivial next to the real and
imminent prospect of having a complete stranger (1) focus their
attention intensely on my scrotum for a half hour and also (2) cut it
and certain of its contents with a knife. I have only recently become
even mildly comfortable being seen naked, even in contexts like locker
rooms where it’s 100% standard, so even the first part was going to take
some getting used to, to say nothing of the second. But I knew if I gave
myself <em>too</em> much time to get used to it, I would never get it
done.</p>
<p>I guess that my ambivalence and anxiety about all this is not
uncommon. Insofar as I have a purpose in writing this, it is to reassure
any other bashful and anxiety-prone male-bodied people who are
considering getting a vasectomy that while their anxiety about it isn’t
<em>exactly</em> misplaced, it’s probably not as bad as they imagine or
fear.</p>
<p>I decided to go to Planned Parenthood to have the procedure done,
because I believe they do important work and I wanted any money that I
(or my insurance) had to pay to go to them. Having done so, I recommend
them wholeheartedly. Based on my experience, the whole process goes
something like this:</p>
<section id="the-consultation" class="level2">
<h2>The consultation</h2>
<p>Either because it had been years since my last consultation about it,
or because that consultation wasn’t with Planned Parenthood, I had to
have another one. The consultation is sort of like easy mode for the
actual procedure. There will be some rather frank discussion of your
genitals and what will be happening to them: somewhat like a more
intimate version of the reproduction part of your high school health
class. If you are a prude like me it will be somewhat uncomfortable, but
you’re not in high school anymore, <em>thank God</em>, and everyone will
actually be a grown-up, which is good because they will also need to
look at your penis. This will probably be near the end of the
consultation and I guess it is to make sure there’s nothing going on
down there that would complicate the procedure? I don’t know. Possibly
due to my own mild neuroses, my theory is they’re making sure that
you’re mentally prepared to drop trou when a doctor tells you to,
because otherwise you’re probably gonna have some difficulty when the
time for the actual vasectomy rolls around.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, if you finish the consultation and haven’t changed
your mind, I recommend you schedule the procedure before you leave. This
will keep you from putting it off for another several years and thus
requiring <em>another</em> consultation later, ultimately reducing the
number of strangers who have to look at your penis by one. These are the
kind of optimizations that I, as a now-seasoned vasectomy expert<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote"><a
href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-men-in-us-dont-get-vasectomies">Per
2015 statistics</a>, I am in approximately the top 10% of “married or
in-union” American men in for number of vasectomies achieved, which
makes me an expert by any reasonable definition.<br />
<br />
</span></span>, can help you achieve.</p>
</section>
<section id="pre-procedure-preparation" class="level2">
<h2>Pre-Procedure Preparation</h2>
<p>In the interval between your consultation and when you scheduled the
actual vasectomy, you will definitely not think or feel any anxiety
about it, so I’ll proceed directly to the day of the main event.</p>
<p>You will have to arrange some transportation. If you currently have a
partner and they’re available and on board with your decision, look: I’m
not the boss of them or you, but I think it would be <em>very</em>
reasonable for them to be your chauffeur for the day.</p>
<p>At the consultation, you will have been told to shower. They might
also have asked you to shave your scrotum. My above claim to be an
expert does not apply here, but I can tell you that if you use a
double-edge (or “safety”) razor on your face, you’re in for an
interesting experience.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">If you normally use a straight razor, you’re probably
in for an even more interesting one.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Just remember: unless you do something absolutely
catastrophic, any cuts you inflict on yourself will probably be
shallower than the one you signed up for later today!</p>
</section>
<section id="the-procedure" class="level2">
<h2>The procedure</h2>
<p>Before the procedure starts, someone will talk you through the
process. It will be more or less a rehash of what you were told in the
consultation, I guess <em>in case you forgot</em> in the intervening
time that you’re about to get your scrotum straight up cut open or that
(equally importantly, in my opinion!) it will be anesthetized for the
duration. At Planned Parenthood, they also offered me Xanax to help
manage my anxiety. I was on the fence but ultimately accepted, partly
because I had to admit I <em>was</em> pretty anxious but also to see if
I would find out what Chance the Rapper was on about in <em>Acid
Rap</em>.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: I did not find out what Chance the Rapper was on about
in <em>Acid Rap</em>. In fact the Xanax did not feel like it had much of
an effect on my mental state at all. But considering how anxious I was
about the procedure, the fact that I felt ❝pretty normal❞<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">I’m trying to spread the convention of using these big
quotes as dramatically overemphasized finger-flexion air quotes.
Unfortunately they’re font-dependent and not as distinctive in this font
as I’d prefer.<br />
<br />
</span></span> during it probably means that actually, the drugs did
what they were supposed to. (My dosage was also a lot lower than
Chance’s, no doubt.)</p>
<p>I consider things to have really gotten started when I was given a
heating pad and told to strip from the waist down. The heating pad was
to wrap around my pertinent areas: I was told it would make things
easier for the doctor if they were warm — the rest of the office was
rather cold — this seemed intuitively reasonable, though I didn’t care
to think too hard about it. But making things easier for the doctor did
seem like an extraordinarily good idea.</p>
<p>After I’d made myself ❝comfortable,❞ the doctor came in. I guess we
exchanged some pleasantries or something. He probably reiterated the
process again to some extent. To be honest, mostly what I remember is
the, like, <em>scrotum bib</em> that he put on me: basically one of
those scratchy blue protective sheets like doctors and dentists use to
prevent your various effluvia from getting on things, with a
conveniently-sized hole in it. I remember involuntarily thinking about
that stupid damn <a
href="http://www.thelonelyisland.com/videos/dick-in-a-box/">Dick in a
Box</a> SNL short and experiencing a complicated tangle of emotions at
having it thus forcibly invoked and recontextualized.</p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s talk about that air-quotes ❝pretty normal❞ a
few paragraphs up. You might think that what I mean by that is “pretty
normal, <em>considering</em>” or “pretty normal, <em>aside from</em>”
and while there were admittedly a few interjections from the doctor that
would be <em>unexpected</em> in a typical polite conversation<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">The most notable and unlikely of these being a bright
and chipper “Wanna see your vas?” While I understood the impulse — this
is, after all, a once in a lifetime opportunity, one fervently hopes —
my baseline level of adventurousness had been exhausted when I accepted
the Xanax.<br />
<br />
</span></span>, overall we mostly small talked about our hobbies and
things. In fact I was probably at least as comfortable as I usually am
when I’m cornered into directionless small talk in any other setting. At
the time this seemed completely unremarkable. In retrospect it seems
like extremely strong evidence that the Xanax worked.</p>
<p>You will, perhaps, be curious about the pain level. I haven’t
mentioned it yet because it was almost too mild to bear mentioning, but
since it was a significant source of my own anxiety I’ll expand on that
a little. I can’t speak to anyone else’s experience, but on at least one
occasion the doctor said something like “You’ll feel a little pinch in
3… 2… 1…” and at the end of the countdown I felt <em>nothing
whatsoever</em>. On other occasions I did feel some pain, sometimes
without any warning, but not once was it worse than if I’d cut myself
while shaving. Overall: extremely strong evidence that the local
anesthetic <em>also</em> worked.</p>
</section>
<section id="recovery" class="level2">
<h2>Recovery</h2>
<p>I’d love to be able to tell you that when the anesthetic wore off it
hurt like hell, and that I gritted my teeth and toughed it out, <em>like
a Man.</em> In fact: no. And not “no, I failed to tough it out,” but
“no, the pain was almost negligible.” When the anesthetic wore off I
was, like, a little sore. I popped a couple acetaminophen the first
night afterwards, and didn’t even feel the need to bother after that.
Getting kicked in the balls in Tae Kwon Do, as a child, was worse. My
partner probably suffers worse and longer-lasting pain <em>every
month</em> from cramps. In fact, By quantifying my pain levels using an
adapted version of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmidt_sting_pain_index">Schmidt
sting pain index</a> — they topped out at about a 1.2 — and comparing
pain sources using some basic integral calculus, I proved that the most
<em>cumulative</em> pain I experienced as a result of my vasectomy was
collateral damage to adjacent areas when the my hair started growing
back and got to that point where it was all spiky. (It’s now been about
three weeks and it’s actually still at that point, though it’s finally
tapering off.) That couple weeks’ worth of minor, intermittent
discomfort adds up to more pain than I experienced during the actual
vasectomy and subsequent recovery period.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">I did not actually do any of the math stuff.
Nevertheless I stand by my conclusion.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
</section>
<section id="in-summary" class="level2">
<h2>In summary</h2>
<p>If you have been thinking about getting a vasectomy but anxiety about
awkwardness or pain has kept you from following through, I’m here to
tell you it’s probably not nearly as bad as you imagine. And it’s the
responsible thing to do if you don’t want kids, far easier than the
equivalent procedure for your potentially childbearing partner and more
reliable than lots of other kinds of birth control. Finally, if my
experience is any indication, it may even make you more comfortable
discussing and taking control of your sexual health, which I think is an
important thing to be able to do!</p>
<p>That said, in a couple months I’m going to have to rub one out into a
jar, bring it across town, and <em>hand it to another human</em> so they
can check and make sure the vasectomy worked. While my experience with
the vasectomy has given me the utmost confidence that the
professionalism of the Planned Parenthood staff will make this minimally
awkward, please do not expect a detailed follow-up blog post about that
experience. Thanks for reading???</p>
