    <h1>My Favorite Music In 2009</h1>
    
    <p>
So I actually listened to some new music this year, although I didn’t go
out on too many limbs. Gonna try to put them in some semblance of order,
in ascending order of how much I listened or want to listen to them;
drumroll, please…
</p>
<dl>
<dt>
The Flaming Lips - <em>Embryonic</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Gotta admit, I don’t listen to the Flaming Lips much. I mean I liked
“Fight Test” okay when it came up on the radio but it wasn’t like THIS
IS A REVELATION I NEED MORE FLAMING LIPS, STAT. It was ok pop music,
basically, not that it makes me a good person to judge a band by its
radio singles. <em>Embryonic</em> is basically being roundly hailed as a
rebirth for the band, and the band seems to be embracing this with all
kinds of unsubtle vaginal imagery in both the
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/images/B002MJM88O/ref=dp_image_0?ie=UTF8&amp;n=5174&amp;s=music">album
cover</a> and the
<a href="http://www.buzzgrinder.com/2009/flaming-lips-watching-the-planets-nsfw/">video
for the last song</a> (VERY NSFW, NAKED PEOPLE AHOY) on the album, which
(the imagery) makes the band name sound like something that someone
really ought to see an OB-GYN about.
</p>
<p>
But I digress! Really I’m not sure what to think of this album. I mean
it starts with basically the skronkiest guitar sound I’ve heard in years
and only gets more psychadelic from there, and those of you who know me
will know that “psychadelic” isn’t really my thing, but on the other
hand it’s a double album that I don’t end up drumming my fingers and
waiting for it to be over! The lyrics are frankly kind of stupid in
places and New Age-y almost everywhere, but they’re serviceable and
inoffensive and the focus is really on the weird-ass music. And this
album really does have the works in terms of weird-assery. One of the
songs samples what I can only assume is a lecture on some kind of higher
mathematics, to give you an idea. It’s not necessarily all that melodic,
but it is cohesive and compelling, and with some more TLC it might have
been higher on this list.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Points of entry:</strong> I don’t know, actually; when I throw
this album on, all the songs kind of blend together, like they should in
a good cohesive album. Not to say they’re homogeneous, because they’re
not, just that they flow well. The first track, “Convinced of the Hex,”
sets the stage very well, with the tone of menace that’s sustained for
almost the whole length, and also has that skronky guitar I was talking
about.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
Circulatory System - <em>Signal Morning</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
I’m showing my preference for (a) more melodic music by (b) bands I
already know by putting this and <em>Embryonic</em> at the bottom of my
list, which is why I can’t really claim any aspirations toward making a
significant pastime out of music writing. Circulatory System has some
distant ties to Neutral Milk Hotel, which as you may know released one
of the most highly regarded indie albums of all time — <em>In the
Aeroplane Over the Sea</em> — about a decade ago. Maybe you didn’t. I
guess my point is that this band has a pedigree.
</p>
<p>
<em>Signal Morning</em> is no <em>Aeroplane Over the Sea</em> or it’d
probably be my number 1, but it’s got that tender, flaky combination of
moist sumptuous melodies and mildly abrasive electronica and distortion.
It’s almost old-style (more on what I mean by this later) Fiery
Furnaces-esque in this combination, and suspect that it too will reveal,
you know, facets and shit with repeated listening. The FFs have made me
feel that it’s not really anything breathtakingly new, and some of the
songs are a little directionless and tuneless for me, but there are some
tracks that take risks and succeed gloriously. Also the album ends with
the title track, and I always love that (see:
<a href="http://www.lastplanetojakarta.com/articles/destroy.html">Destroyer’s
<em>Thief</em></a>, and by the way that link is to an article by John
Darnielle about said album, or really more about Destroyer in general,
which is pretty awesome in several ways).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Points of entry:</strong> “Round Again” sums this album up
pretty well, with its endless variations on one motif and propensity for
changing gears in the middle without sounding like a totally new song
(which is what sets these guys apart from the Fiery Furnaces’ early
albums). Same applies to “Blasting Through,” maybe even more so.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
The Fiery Furnaces, <em>I’m Going Away</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Wow! The Fiery Furnaces make an album that sounds kind of normal! I
don’t like it as much as the stuff that was totally fucked! But it’s a
damn fine album nonetheless. Certainly easier to listen to than, say,
<em>Widow City</em>, which I can’t imagine most people throwing on while
trying to do their math homework.
</p>
<p>
Eleanor’s lyrics on <em>I’m Going Away</em> ain’t winning no prizes from
me — I have to admit I prefer Matt’s ridiculously detailed and
impossible-to-sing vague story tunes to Eleanor’s more conventional
tales of woe and loss — but they do probably suit the music better than
Matt’s words would. All in all, this is the album the Furnaces-skeptics
have been clamoring for ever since some fool wrote that they could be a
good band if they just reined in their excesses and wrote the pop songs
we all knew they had in them. Here you go, guys. It’s no <em>Blueberry
Boat</em>, but it’s pretty good.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Points of Entry:</strong> Lead single “Even In The Rain” is,
indeed, a top-notch pop song, despite the WTF-inducing guitar solo (of
which there are many on this album; one gets the sense that Matt poured
some of his weirdness into his guitar work since it doesn’t manifest
itself as much in the songwriting). Anyway, the
<a href="http://stereogum.com/archives/video/new_fiery_furnaces_video__even_in_the_rain_103921.html">video</a>
is pretty funny too. I think the best song might be “Staring at the
Steeple,” with a lumbering menace that the rest of the album lacks.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
Blackout Beach, <em>Skin of Evil</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Conventional pop album → weird, spiky, fucking oppressive album. You may
but probably don’t know Carey Mercer as the evil genius behind Frog
Eyes, makers of some of the most demented music I’ve had the pleasure to
experience, and here he’s recording under a new name. He’s toned down
the manic intensity of some of Frog Eyes’ work but left in all the
menace and masculine fury (“…but fucking William, I want to crack his
neck and perform one million castrations with his bones…”) in a vaguely
elaborated concept album about a woman, Donna, and the men who loved her
and still probably do. Or hate her, or more likely hate the other men
who loved her. All of the above.
</p>
<p>
Mercer’s lyrics are almost incomprehensible when you listen but
<a href="http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendId=429062406&amp;blogId=448229863">fascinating
when you read them</a>, and they lend a lot of weight to an album with
kind of a thin concept. Hell, so do the song titles — “Cloud of Evil,”
“Nineteen, One God, One Dull Star,” “Astoria, Menthol Lite, Hilltop,
Wave of Evil 1982” — and the music, which honestly I can hardly call any
of it to mind right now. All I can think of when I think of this album
is Mercer’s voice, intoning threats and mantras and unhinged missives. I
imagine this Donna as a light too bright to look at directly — she gets
a song, “Woe to the Minds of Soft Men,” whose name is also its only
lyric — and the other men as planets, orbiting her in a cold, terrible
emptiness and occasionally shooting lasers at each other for having the
audacity to orbit the same star.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Points of Entry:</strong> Well at this point you’re probably
skeptical that there are any. And I hate to keep just picking the first
song on the album, but the first song here, “Cloud of Evil,” really does
pretty much open things up just the way it should. Hell, just those
drums at the beginning make me a little uncomfortable. Which is
basically what this album should do.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
The Decemberists - <em>The Hazards of Love</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Man some people had a hate-on for this album. Other people freaking
loved it. It’s not the Decemberists’ best album. I mean let’s face it,
two of the songs are exactly the same except the lyrics, which is
pardonable in a concept album that tells a mostly coherent story but
still seems a bit phoned in. And the first like 5 or so songs are
pleasant enough but kind of drag a little. Maybe a little boring, even.
And I don’t really like Becky Stark, one of the guest vocalists who
features prominently in them.
</p>
<p>
But! I’ll take a slow first few tracks over the massive front-loading
that so many bands do these days. And I think I’ve mentioned how the
<em>other</em> guest vocalist, Shara Worden, completely blows the shit
out of the water in every track she appears on, and it’s like the first
word she sings jolts the album out of its first few tracks’ stupor and
everything from then on careens unstoppably toward its unavoidable,
tragic and slightly nonsensical conclusion. Not the best album from the
Decemberists, but the most ambitious, the hardest rocking, and
ultimately the most deliciously over-the-top.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Points of Entry:</strong> More than any other album on this
list, this one is a narrative, and so any individual track will suffer.
But <em>The Rake’s Song</em> got some radio airplay, and it’s a good
Decemberists-y pop song about murdering one’s offspring, and the
aforementioned Worden-inspired shit-blowing-out-of-water occurs in “The
Wanting Comes In Waves/Repaid,” so you might want to check that one out
too.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
DOOM - <em>Born Like This</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This album is basically DOOM doing his thing again. Me, I love the thing
he does, so it was pretty much a given that I’d be a fan of <em>Born
Like This</em>, and from what I’ve heard I think it’s my favorite of
DOOM’s solo releases and a hair above Vaudeville Villain (DOOM’s alter
ego Viktor Vaughn’s album). Not as good as <em>Madvillainy</em> (but
then, what is?) and difficult to compare to <em>The Mouse and the
Mask</em>.
</p>
<p>
Lyrically, DOOM’s never been stronger, enough so that the guest spots
kind of irritate me even though they’re not bad. The lyrics are somewhat
heavier than they’ve been in the past, with DOOM trading Adult Swim for
Bukowski, but the flow is the same, and of course I eat that shit up,
even though I wrinkle my nose at the playful but nonetheless repugnant
homophobia (disguised as superhero roasting, but not very well) in
“Batty Boyz.” Goddamn that track and my feeling like I need to make
excuses for liking this album even though it’s on there. The bottom line
is that DOOM is as solid as ever, and the beats are among the best he’s
ever rapped over, with “Gazzillion Ear” kicking things off in fine form
with a sweet gear-change a third of the way through, “That’s That”
featuring an effective but (to my ear) unconventional use of strings
under some of the most enjoyably tongue-twisting lyrics on the album,
and “Supervillainz” knocking things down with a beat so rambunctious and
asinine that the album dissolves into nonsense after it. Woo!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Points of Entry:</strong> I mean,
“<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUZ7-C0wPF4&amp;feature=related">Gazzillion
Ear</a>” is good enough that Thom Yorke (!) thought it would be a good
idea to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0lUI6NQynA">remix
it</a> (!!??!?), so it’s probably as good a starting point as any.
Arguably, though, the centerpiece of the album is “Cellz,” which opens
with the aforementioned Bukowski reading and concludes with DOOM
basically, as far as I can tell, yelling at those damn kids to get off
his lawn (“Kids doing skid bids, acting out is terrible/Word is bond,
fix your clothes, put a shirt on/Pants sagging back when used to meant
you had a skirt on/Squirts posin’ as thuggers and hustlers”). I’m
looking forward to some fucking crotchety old-man rap on DOOM’s next
album in 2012.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
the Mountain Goats - <em>The Life of the World to Come</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Well, obviously. The only surprise about this album is that it’s not at
the top (well, technically the bottom) of this list. <em>TLOTWTC</em>
(not a good acronym, but better than typing out the full album name) has
drawn comparisons to the Mountain Goats’ other “difficult” album <em>Get
Lonely</em> because of its lack of rollicking uptempo numbers about
people reaching the ends of their ropes, wanting to kill each other,
etc., where it sounds like John Darnielle’s just got to be getting
spittle <em>all over</em> that microphone — furious travelogue “Psalms
40:2” (which they
<a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/251985/october-06-2009/the-mountain-goats---psalms-40-2">played
on the Goddamn <em>Colbert Report</em></a>) being a notable exception.
</p>
<p>
But, of course, <em>TLOTWTC</em> still has songs about people in
cul-de-sacs and bottoms of pits, who can only hope that there’s no way
to go but up, because those people are and have always been John
Darnielle’s stock in trade. It’s just that on <em>Get Lonely</em> and
this album they don’t so often feel the need to yell about it.
</p>
<p>
Last year’s <em>Heretic Pride</em> seemed to me like tMG’s “Awesome, we
have a drummer now!” album, but now that Jon Wurster’s presence has had
some time to sink in he’s not busting out his mad chops as often. The
drumming on <em>TLOTWTC</em> is atmospheric as often as it is propulsive
— viz. the first and last tracks — and it works to the album’s credit.
tMG have never been about virtuosity, but Wurster is a skilled drummer,
and even when he’s not flagrantly showcasing that skill he’s subtly
lending some extra oomph to the quieter tracks.
</p>
<p>
There are a lot of quieter tracks on <em>TLOTWTC</em>, many of which are
genuinely affecting; my two favorite examples of this are “Deuteronomy
2:10,” a startlingly vivid evocation of three creatures facing their
species’ extinctions, and “Matthew 25:21,” wherein Darnielle is himself
the character at the end of his rope as he faces his mother-in-law’s
death from cancer. Oh, by the way, all the tracks are named after Bible
verses, in case you hadn’t heard. Despite this, Darnielle’s lyrics are
in much the same vein as ever: sometimes inscrutable, as in the probably
heavily metaphorical Christian-about-to-get-eaten-by-lions (maybe?
unless the “beast” mentioned is the Devil?) song
“<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KocfvqK_4yM&amp;feature=related">1
John 4:16</a>,” and sometimes pretty much totally straightforward, as in
“Matthew 25:21.” All in all, it’s another Mountain Goats album that
doesn’t disappoint, and I expect nothing less than the best from them
anymore.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Points of Entry:</strong> Well, as I said, “Psalms 40:2” got
played on the Colbert Report, so I guess the band thinks it’s the best
hook to draw people in, and I can’t really disagree. At the other end of
the spectrum, there’s the last song on the album, “Ezekiel 7 and the
Permanent Efficacy of Grace,” which has a nice
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-zZJu6LKI">video</a> that has
the vocals mixed too high but will still give you an idea of what to
expect from the several piano-driven songs on <em>TLOTWTC</em>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
Sunset Rubdown - <em>Dragonslayer</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Poor Spencer Krug and his Sunset Rubdown didn’t even make my list the
last year they made an album, <em>Random Spirit Lover</em> in 2007. Too
bloated, hectic, inscrutable, dense and tuneless to my ears. They
knocked it out of the park with <em>Dragonslayer</em>, though, a concise
10-song warrior of an album with hella catchy melodies, typically
labyrinthine and literate lyrics from Krug, and nary a dull moment
anywhere on it.
</p>
<p>
<em>Dragonslayer</em> is supposedly the result of a conscious effort on
the part of the band to use fewer overdubs, but it still gets pretty
busy in places. The big difference I hear is that the songs are actually
really good. <em>Random Spirit Lover</em> devotees have been decrying
the lack of experimentation, but few of <em>Dragonslayer</em>’s songs
are structured in any kind of conventional way, and there’s enough
abrasive guitar squalling for <em>me</em>, at least, on “Black Swan,”
which for some reason seems to be the lead single, if indeed that’s what
the presence of a
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJizd1JwRks">trippy video</a>
indicates.
</p>
<p>
Spencer Krug’s voice is the same as it ever was: “yelpy” is the (not
actually a) word that comes to mind. For me, it’s remarkably effective
when it’s put into the service of some actual compelling melodies, and
<em>Dragonslayer</em> has them in spades. Add in the metaphor-laden
lyrics that seem to reveal more about what Krug’s yelping about with
every listen while still keeping some essential kernel of truth shrouded
in mystery, and you’ve got the whole package: an album that feels like
it’s just the right length, and one that’s as immediate as it can be
while still demanding repeated listenings. All that and the goddamn
thing’s only $5 if you
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002COPPRA/sr=1-1/qid=1263351079/ref=sr_digr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1263351079&amp;sr=1-1">buy
it through Amazon</a>, and has been for months! Of the albums I’ve heard
this year, this one’s the best, and it’s an uncontested best, not like
in previous years. Do yourself a favor and go get it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Points of Entry:</strong> Probably the rockingest song on the
album is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnnuGZ3QKgM">Idiot
Heart</a>, which I gather has been around for a while but kicks ass in
its final form here. My favorite of the more subdued tracks is
“<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eh6jWLmKcc">Nightingale/December
Song</a>,” which contains some references to previous Krug lyrical
mythology but has a lyric that stands alone too: “Like all fireworks and
all sunsets, we all burn in different ways/You are a vast explosion and
I am the embers,” so good! Most of the tracks are on YouTube, actually,
and it’s hard to pick any more to put above the others, they’re all so
good. Other tracks on this album are “You Go On Ahead,” “Silver Moons”
and “Dragon’s Lair.”
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
And then, of course, there are some albums I just didn’t get around to
absorbing like I ought to’ve. Among them:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Raekwon - <em>Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, Pt. II</em>
</li>
<li>
Animal Collective - <em>Merriweather Post Pavilion</em>
</li>
<li>
The xx - <em>xx</em> (certainly the most intriguingly titled band/album
debut of the year)
</li>
<li>
Grizzly Bear - <em>Veckatimest</em>
</li>
<li>
Phoenix - <em>Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix</em> (I think this one will take
about two more listens to sink in; it’s pop, pure and simple)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Lastly, a couple EPs that bear mentioning: Destroyer’s <em>Bay of
Pigs</em>, mostly just the title track, which is standard-issue
Destroyer lyrics (beginning with the apt line “Listen/I’ve been
drinking”) over a surprisingly effective “ambient disco” backing track,
and Moonface (actually just Spencer Krug under <em>yet another</em>
pseudonym) with “Dreamland EP: marimba and shit-drums,” which I’ve
actually only listened through once because it came out last month, but
right now I’m feeling like Krug can do no wrong, Random Spirit Lover
notwithstanding, and of course the EP’s name is an obvious winner.
</p>
<p>
Here’s to an awesome musical 2010. I’ve already got the new Vampire
Weekend (preliminary verdict: too much studio fuckery, songs not as
good, still fun) and the new Owen Pallett (previously Final Fantasy)
(preliminary verdict: if the chips were down I might go gay for him).
&lt;3 music!
