    <h3>
Top 10 Albums of 2007, in order. Album cover pictures link to pertinent
YouTube videos.
</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>of Montreal</strong>, <em>Hissing Fauna, Are You the
Destroyer?</em> (link goes to “Gronlandic Edit”
video)<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBfgQvM7wtE"><img class="albumcover" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51IRh7DUUbL._AA240_.jpg" /></a>
</p>
<p>
Okay, so this wasn’t like last year where I had a clear #1 album (The
Decemberists’ <em>The Crane Wife</em>), so I thought fairly long and
hard about this before I just went to iTunes and picked the album with
the highest play count. Fine, this is a lame move. Fine, it favors
albums released earlier in the year. But the more I think about this
one, the more it makes sense to me, so I’m sticking with it.
</p>
<p>
<em>Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?</em> carries on the proud
tradition of incredibly catchy music about incredibly sad things. Here
the topic is the lead singer’s divorce from his wife, and <em>Hissing
Fauna</em> does indeed contain probably the most sugar-perfect pop song
of the year, unwieldily titled “Heimdalsgate Like a Promethean Curse.”
</p>
<p>
<em>Hissing Fauna</em>’s striking cover art reflects its contents: two
borderline-manic explosions of colorful sound bisected by an encroaching
darkness. The first half of the album is six songs of pitch-perfect pop;
the aforementioned darkness, on the album, takes the form of “The Past
is a Grotesque Animal,” an almost 12-minute rambling breakdown of a
song. Such a thing might seem like a horrible mistake, plopped right in
the middle of a pop album, but for me it works remarkably well.
</p>
<p>
On the other side, <em>Hissing Fauna</em> suddenly becomes some kind of
funk album or something? I don’t know. “The Past Is…” clearly signals
some kind of turning point, and the songs get considerably more chaotic
and loosely structured, less straight-up pop, more weird sexiness mixed
in. And after all that, it manages to end on an optimistic note. Please
note that the lead singer and his wife have since reconciled.
</p>
<p>
So I’m saying this album is #1 because it’s big and brassy and
unpredictable, it’s both like and unlike anything Of Montreal have ever
done, and totally unlike anything else I’ve heard this year, and it
takes risks and they pay off. Also it just flat-out has some kick-ass
songs on it.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>The Veils</strong>, <em>Nux Vomica</em> (link to “Calliope!”
video)<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24rEZS4pD3s"><img class="albumcover" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ph1Zt5GEL._AA240_.jpg" /></a>
</p>
<p>
<em>Nux Vomica</em> is courtesy of my brother, who recommended the Veils
to me when we were in Florida. In terms of the lyrics and vocals, I’m
moved to compare them to Radiohead with a splash of Pixies, but those
kinds of comparisons are never really fair or terribly accurate.
Combined with my putting the album at #2, though, I hope that comparison
will indicate what an impression <em>Nux Vomica</em> made on me.
</p>
<p>
For me, the standouts on this album are the two singles “Calliope!” and
“<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YowBKqrpJdc&amp;feature=related">Advice
for Young Mothers to Be</a>” (link to ridiculously adorable video) and
the title track, but there’s not a bad song in the bunch. Like Hissing
Fauna, <em>Nux Vomica</em> is often given to melodrama and grand
gestures, but the Veils carry them off with aplomb and the occasional
touch of musical whimsy keeps the album from collapsing under its own
weight.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Spoon</strong>, <em>Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga</em> (link to “Don’t You
Evah” video)
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPdP1jBfxzo"><img class="albumcover" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61IPAfsjlIL._AA240_.jpg" /></a>
</p>
<p>
Ok, so yes, this album kind of has the stupidest name ever.
</p>
<p>
It has also been, for me, the easiest album to just throw on when I
don’t want to wrestle with my music, I just want to listen to
ridiculously kick-ass songs for just over a half hour.
<em>Ga<sup>5</sup></em> doesn’t wear out its welcome, it just saunters
in, straight up <em>delivers</em> for thirty-six and a half minutes, and
rolls out just as nonchalantly as it rolled in.
</p>
<p>
I’m no Spoon fanatic either. I got their last album, <em>Gimme
Fiction</em>, a couple years ago, and I didn’t see what the big deal
was. Sure it had some decent tunes but it seemed like people were making
a way bigger deal out of it than it deserved. <em>Ga<sup>5</sup></em>
sounds like the exact opposite of a big deal. Unlike my #s 1 and 2, it
doesn’t make any grand gestures, doesn’t try to dazzle you, never
teeters on the edge of being overbearing. It’s just ten really tight,
catchy and well-constructed songs, the kind of album it would have been
easy but criminally unfair to let slip under my radar.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Radiohead</strong>, <em>In Rainbows</em>
(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukythkK4EPQ&amp;feature=user">link
to “Scotch Mist,” a 50-minute long video with studio performances of
every song from <em>In Rainbows</em></a>, my wasn’t this band generous
this year)
</p>
<p>
What is there even to say about this album that hasn’t been said a
million times? It’s Radiohead at their most concise and their least
impenetrable. It sounds like the album Thom Yorke’s voice was made for,
more than any other Radiohead album, and after the first two songs it
may be more cohesive than any other Radiohead album. And like my numbers
1, 2, and 3, there’s not a bad song on it.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Deer Tick</strong>, <em>War Elephant</em> (link to “Art Isn’t
Real (City of Sin)” live
video)<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GjWh7tiV4g&amp;feature=related"><img class="albumcover" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/a8/e8/d80690b809a02a4ba3796110._AA240_.L.jpg" /></a>
</p>
<p>
Finally, I have escaped the triteness of “I like everything except rap
and country.” Well, sort of. I conquered my rap aversion a couple years
ago,but country music remained an undiscovered, um, country to me until
now. Though <em>War Elephant</em> isn’t really country, I think, except
to a neophyte like myself: I tell myself it is because it sort of has a
twang, but it’s probably more of an indie-folk hybrid of some kind.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, though, the fact is that the songs, with few exceptions (and
there are bound to be a few on a 14-song album), are great, with
<em>three</em> —- “Ashamed,”
“<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GjWh7tiV4g&amp;feature=related">Diamond
Rings 2007</a>,” (link to live video) and “Christ Jesus” —- that merit
consideration for a top songs list. The singer was apparently 21 or
younger when he wrote some of these songs, which is kind of incredible
because the lyrics sound like they were written by someone far more
world-weary than a 21-year-old has any right to be, and his voice sounds
like he’s had a pack-a-day smoking habit for at least 17 years. But God
damn can he write a song, and that’s really what matters.
</p>
</li>

<p>
<strong>Deerhoof</strong>, <em>Friend Opportunity</em>
</p>
<p>
So a while ago I tried to listen to Deerhoof. They had just released a
free and untitled EP, and it had a Beatles cover (“Bungalow Bill”) on
it, and so I gave it a spin, said What the fuck is this shit, and forgot
about Deerhoof until they released <em>Friend Opportunity</em>, which I
downloaded from eMusic because it was only ten songs and I figured, what
the hell.
</p>
<p>
I don’t remember what my initial reaction to <em>Friend Opportunity</em>
was, whether I said AUGGH WHY DIDN’T I LEARN MY LESSON or thought it was
potentially pretty rad, but. Um. Turns out it’s pretty rad?
</p>
<p>
So now I have everything Deerhoof’s done in the last five years, almost,
and I can safely say that <em>Friend Opportunity</em> is probably the
best point of entry. Deerhoof is a noisy, sometimes unsettlingly
discordant band, with a little Japanese singer who seems completely out
of place, and it may well be that you just love them or hate them and
that’s that. But at least the songs on <em>Friend Opportunity</em>
actually sound like straight-up pop songs, with a couple exceptions. The
opening trifecta of “The Perfect Me,” “+81” and “Believe E.S.P.” is
probably the most awesomely spazz-rockin’ nine minutes of music I’ve
heard this year, or possibly ever, and if it doesn’t win you over, then
maybe Deerhoof is just not for you.
</p>
<p>
<small>and maybe you need to get your <em>head checked</em></small>
</p>

<li>
<p>
<strong>The New Pornographers</strong>, <em>Challengers</em> (link to
simultaneously disgusting and adorable title track video)
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHWWWa8EvzI"><img class="albumcover" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61kTfGlR5PL._AA240_.jpg" /></a>
</p>
<p>
So if you’re not in love with The New Pornographers, you should go
listen to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBAUQaj6EJo">Letter
For An Occupant</a> (link to video) immediately and remedy that. From
their first album, it basically encapsulates everything that made their
first three albums wonderful, and yet there’s not much on
<em>Challengers</em> that sounds anything like it.
</p>
<p>
Instead of raucous, exuberant power pop, on <em>Challengers</em> we get
ballads and a six-and-a-half minute epic, but despite the left turn I
think <em>Challengers</em> is as strong as anything else the New
Pornographers have done. The hooks are still there, but you might have
to listen two or even three* times before they catch; meanwhile, the
melodies like the one on the title track and “Unguided” (the ballad and
the epic, respectively) start to sink in, too. In the end,
<em>Challengers</em> is at its weakest during the straight-up power pop
songs, which give the impression that they were included just because
that’s what people have come to expect. But this album is delightful for
anyone who can approach it without such expectations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Future of the Left</strong>, <em>Curses</em> (link to
“adeadenemyalwayssmellsgood” video)
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu6wJveSWRU"><img class="albumcover" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41x94wsYHLL._AA240_.jpg" /></a>
</p>
<p>
Boy did this one catch me off guard.
</p>
<p>
<em>Curses</em> is the most consistently loud album I’ve listened to
since I was on my System of a Down kick, and for that reason I was
almost sure I wasn’t going to like it. But I had read some good stuff
about it, so I decided to give it a try, and well I guess it sort of
blew me away? Because it really rocks, and not in a stupid or annoying
way. It has the perfect balance of melody and plain ol’ shouting,
punctuated with screams and falsetto just to remind you that they’re
having fun and you damn well should be too.
</p>
<p>
For such a noisy album, <em>Curses</em> packs an awful lot more variety
than some of the other loud stuff I’ve listened to in the past, but
pretty much every one of its 15 songs has something to recommend it.
That’s an impressive accomplishment. My only beef is that the lyrics
don’t make any sense at all, but when the songs kick this much ass, they
don’t really need to.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Menomena</strong>, <em>Friend and Foe</em> (link to “Wet and
Rusting” video)
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iqg3LVx2Ws&amp;feature=related"><img class="albumcover" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71q7uIWYAhL._AA240_.jpg" /></a>
</p>
<p>
Of all the albums on this list, this one is probably the hardest for me
to pin down. <em>Hissing Fauna</em> is pop. <em>Ga<sup>5</sup></em> is
rock. <em>In Rainbows</em> is… Radiohead. But I can’t really sum up
<em>Friend and Foe</em> so briefly. One of the songs from it came up
randomly when I was playing my music at home and my mom said it sounded
like gorilla jungle music or something. But she likes Neil Young, so
what does she know.
</p>
<p>
I guess <em>Friend and Foe</em> is basically rock, but it’s heavily
loop-based rock, and the band apparently writes the songs using software
programmed by one of its members, which is pretty hardcore. It announces
itself incredibly boldly, with a thunderclap of drums at the beginning
of “Muscle ‘n Flo” that abruptly drops out to make way for the singer.
That kind of momentum is hard to maintain and <em>Friend and Foe</em>
doesn’t quite manage it, but they do their best for the first half and
then change course to something a little weirder and more somber for the
second. I can’t say what it is that makes this album so compelling;
perhaps it’s the same thing that makes it hang together so well despite
its containing both straight-up rock and gorilla jungle music.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Battles</strong>, <em>Mirrored</em> (link to “Atlas” video)
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpGp-22t0lU&amp;feature=related"><img class="albumcover" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51F3ig8lYGL._AA240_.jpg" /></a>
</p>
<p>
This is the album in my top 10 that I listen to the least. It’s the
hardest to just throw on; it’s basically impossible to sing along to;
and it’s dense, complicated, weird and only sporadically melodic. But
it’s also wholly unlike anything else I’ve ever heard. It’s rock music
and I guess it’s electronica too, it’s like robot music made by robots
advanced enough to play actual instruments as well as people do, which
is very advanced indeed.
</p>
<p>
<em>Mirrored</em> is something of a cacophony of loops and beats and
distorted vocals. Melodies surface occasionally but they sound like some
kind of space melodies. At times it is extremely hard to believe the
music is being played on actual instruments, but watch how they recreate
lead single “Atlas” live and you’ll see them
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWaTKpWcb4Q">pull it off
flawlessly</a> (link to live “Atlas” video), with two band members each
playing a melody on guitar and keyboard <em>at the same time.</em> That
will be when you know that Battles is very special indeed.

<h3>
Top 10 Songs of 2007
</h3>
<p>
These are not in any particular order. They’re songs that were on albums
not in my top 10, or songs that were but are just too good not to be
listened to. Song names link to mp3 downloads.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Frog Eyes</strong>, “Bushels”</p>
<p>
Frog Eyes are a tough band. Their music can be a jumble and the singer
can sometimes sound like a wild animal. But “Bushels” is an amazing
song, all nine minutes of it. From the piano cascades in the beginning
to the downtempo lament at the end that disintegrates into exuberant
yelping, there’s not a second of this song that doesn’t keep me riveted.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sunset Rubdown</strong>, “Up on Your Leopard, Upon the End of
Your Feral Days”</p>
<p>
Sunset Rubdown had high honors from me last year but their new album
<em>Random Spirit Lover</em> just seemed too busy and incomprehensible
to me. But their newly found manic-ness works best for me in this song,
which has a strong melody and a bridge that tugs at the ol’
heartstrings, which is really what Spencer Krug does best while keeping
you totally in the dark as to what the hell he’s on about.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Veils</strong>, “Nux Vomica”</p>
<p>
The two singles on <em>Nux Vomica</em> are good, sure, but the title
track blows them out of the water with its total mastery of the
soft/loud/soft dynamic and perfect jagged stabs of sound punctuating the
organ and bass of the verses. This is a really ambitious song and
everything about it works big time.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Battles</strong>, “Atlas”</p>
<p>
Whether or not you like Battles, this is a song that everyone should be
able to agree on, because it fucking <em>destroys</em>. The way it
builds and falls, ebbs and flows, the melody, the intertwining of the
different instruments, all combine to make it an absolutely top-notch
floor-stomper of a song.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deer Tick</strong>, “Christ Jesus”</p>
<p>
Like “Nux Vomica”, this is a daring song that makes the most of the
risks it takes. It’s the most anguished song on an album that’s full of
them, with the vocals unaccompanied except for a single thunderous bass
for almost half of the song. But those vocals, how they draw you in, so
much so that the explosive flourishes at the end seem entirely
appropriate.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Joanna Newsom</strong>, “Colleen”</p>
<p>
This is the only new song Joanna Newsom recorded this year, for the
<em>Joanna Newsome and the Ys Street Band</em> EP, and I guess it’s
about a woman who used to be a whale? No, not fat, like an <em>actual
whale</em>. At about 6 minutes, it splits the difference between the
epic <em>Ys</em> and Newsom’s somewhat more accessible first album, and
it takes the best parts of both. Newsom’s band is top-notch and her
little “yip”s after the “chorus” melody are priceless.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Les Savy Fav</strong>, “The Equestrian”
<p>
<em>Curses</em> out-rocked Les Savy Fav’s new album <em>Let’s Stay
Friends</em> on my top albums list, but “The Equestrian” out-rocks even
a good deal of <em>Curses</em>. I guess it’s basically about fucking in
a stable, which if that’s Les Savy Fav’s thing then good for them or
whatever, but the point is that it really gets that “rough sex” kind of
feeling across with its momentum and volume. Not that I am an authority
on rough sex.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The New Pornographers</strong>, “Myriad Harbour”</p>
<p>
So what happened is that the weird guy Dan Bejar who’s sort of in the
New Pornographers but sort of isn’t, and who usually writes the songs
that a lot of people probably skip, penned the catchiest song on their
newest album. How this happened I do not know, since basically the lead
New Pornos guy is one of the greatest pop geniuses of the decade as far
as I’m concerned. But he decided to get all down-tempo and sedate on
<em>Challengers</em>, and that’s like Bejar’s bread and butter so maybe
it leveled the playing field a little? Anyway what I’m trying to say is
that this is a damn catchy song.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>of Montreal</strong>, “Heimdalsgate Like a Promethean
Curse”</p>
<p>
of Montreal is the thinking man or woman’s synth-pop, and “Heimdalsgate”
proves it with an unbelievably hooky song about hormonal imbalances and
a disintegrating marriage that references Greek mythology in the title.
It just doesn’t get any better than that, until you actually listen to
the song. And listen to it. And listen to it. And listen to it…
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spoon</strong>, “Finer Feelings”</p>
<p>
Now look, I’m not saying this song is <em>better</em> than “You Got Yr.
Cherry Bomb” or “Don’t You Evah” or “The Underdog”, I’m just saying it’s
what I look forward to when the end of <em>Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga</em> rolls
around and its chorus is right up there with the big boys. So don’t get
all up in arms. “Finer Feelings” is the real underdog on
<em>Ga<sup>5</sup></em> and it needs some love.

Runner-Up Albums
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Shins</strong>, <em>Wincing The Night Away</em></p>
<p>
This album was in close competition with <em>Mirrored</em> but
eventually I realized it was really just another God damn Shins album. I
mean, don’t get me wrong, it’s the God damn Shins, but still, I had to
give the edge to something different. This is a really solid album
though.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Arcade Fire</strong>, <em>Neon Bible</em></p>
<p>
Kinda disappointing at first, definitely grew on me, still not as good
as <em>Funeral</em> by a wide margin. Lots of good tunes but the lyrical
quality is way down. “(Antichrist Television Blues)”, “Keep the Car
Running,” and “No Cars Go” are just about up to the standard set by
<em>Funeral</em>, but that’s about it.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Frog Eyes</strong>, <em>Tears of the Valedictorian</em></p>
<p>
Definitely has a lot to recommend it but I just didn’t find myself going
back to it too often. I think Frog Eyes just doesn’t tend to have enough
melody for me. As I mentioned before, though, “Bushels” is absolutely
incredible.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sunset Rubdown</strong>, <em>Random Spirit Lover</em></p>
<p>
Lives up to its name too much! Long, sprawling, scattershot,
sporadically brilliant, and manic-depressive, songs from this album flow
one to another but seem to lack cohesion nonetheless. Maybe it needs to
grow on me some more, but Sunset Rubdown really needs a point of entry
for this one.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Andrew Bird</strong>, <em>Armchair Apocrypha</em>
<p>
Excellent sedate pop tunes, but in the end this one was too boring for
me. Bird doesn’t seem to be able to muster up a lot of enthusiasm and
his lyrics sometimes seem too clever for their own good.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>My Brightest Diamond</strong>, <em>Bring Me the
Workhorse</em></p>
<p>
Probably the strongest contender for the top 10, with very strong female
vocals bolstered by sparse and effective music. Too much down-tempo
stuff and unevenness to elbow its way up, but definitely a solid album.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Les Savy Fav</strong>, <em>Let’s Stay Friends</em></p>
<p>
Rocks hard but was outdone by <em>Curses</em>. Features Eleanor
Friedberger of the Fiery Furnaces on one track! That’s cool. Lots of
excellent songs, lots that just don’t grab me.
