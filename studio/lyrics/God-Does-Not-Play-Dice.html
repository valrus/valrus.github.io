    <h1>
God Does Not Play Dice
</h1>
    
    

<p>Inevitability didn’t make it any easier;<br />
I couldn’t prepare myself at all.<br />
There was a hundred meter tidal wave headed for me,<br />
and I was building a brick wall.</p>
<p>Who was I kidding<br />
to think that time could heal a wound I hadn’t even been given?<br />
Now I’m tying on a bandage that was torn into ribbons.<br />
It doesn’t work and it hurts like the dickens.</p>
<p>You only wanted three things in life.<br />
It was a kind of joke but I’ve been really dreading the punchline.<br />
The food and affection I could provide you with daily,<br />
but the sleeping is up to you, except for this one time.</p>
<p>You used to seem to vibrate in sixteen different dimensions so how come all of my memories are quiet and empty?<br />
I can’t think back to all the good times without hacking through the bad ones so my only salvation is random acts of distraction.<br />
And every piece of fur I find in my clothing might be the last one.</p>
