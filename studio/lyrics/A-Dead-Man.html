    <h1>
        A Dead Man
    </h1>
    
    <p>I don’t want to make a promise to a dead man.<br />
I don’t have to make a promise to a dead man.<br />
You can’t make me keep a promise to a dead man.<br />
There’s no harm to break a promise to a dead man.</p>
<p>Man, I can’t imagine this actually fucking mattered to you.<br />
I know your heart was shattered so I grant you some latitude.<br />
But how you gonna saddle me with slapstick and platitudes,<br />
evacuate the map and make me maximally mad at you?<br />
I’m not obliging in the best of conditions,<br />
so spare your moralizing if you don’t respect my decisions.<br />
I restore a kind of normalcy in light of attrition<br />
If I ignore the way it tortures me to grapple an apparition.<br />
I’m haunted.<br />
I know we’re all kinda haunted,<br />
but some may be more than others.<br />
Example: me and my brothers.<br />
I’m never free of this vehemence; I don’t hear your rebuttals.<br />
But I see reprieve between my fear and subtle defiance.<br />
I recognize relying on trying to flee is timeless;<br />
if it means that I’m spineless that’s fine<br />
I’ll find a psychiatrist if I need to have time with it.<br />
Until then I consign it to the back of my mind.</p>
<p>That’s why I’ll never make a promise to a dead man.<br />
Don’t want to think about a promise with a dead man.<br />
I’ll never have to keep a promise to a dead man.<br />
Won’t have my peace of mind disrupted by a dead man.</p>
<p>Man, I frickin wish I could forget your little pitiful writ,<br />
in which you tried to stick me with some insignificant shit.<br />
If you could get your mind off yourself for a minute, you could have figured it was imminent that I was considered a grown man,<br />
picking plane tickets and phone plans.<br />
You could have witnessed it instead of bridging the River Styx,<br />
but couldn’t stick it out enough to listen to Foam Hands.<br />
(I think you might have liked it, oh man.)<br />
But since you been gone I got a cold stone heart:<br />
me and you or your memory steadily grown apart.<br />
So you won’t catch me regretfully moaning.<br />
That’s correct: effective starting now I’m rejecting extra emotion.<br />
Truthfully, what the hell did it ever do for me?<br />
Mentally uprooted, induced me to act stupidly?<br />
And it’s tomfoolery how you want me to mourn you.<br />
Well true love regrets to inform you that…</p>
<p>I don’t have to make a promise to a dead man.<br />
You can’t make me make a promise to a dead man.<br />
I think I’ll never make a promise to a dead man.<br />
And I guess I’ll never understand what made a dead man<br />
a dead man.</p>
<p>Man, I guess that your perspective was compressed to ’bout the size of a molecule.<br />
Depression is oppressive when it festers in solitude.<br />
And I was never best at impressions of solidarity.<br />
The mess in my chest, yeah: I see it with total clarity.<br />
I don’t need to be told that I did nothing to help you:<br />
every time you tried to put a feeler out I repelled you,<br />
every deal I made myself to be a healer had fell through,<br />
and now I’m gonna seal away the feelings expelled too.<br />
But it was never my job to be my father’s keeper.<br />
Yeah, I could say you’re with God, but I’m a nonbeliever.<br />
And you were too, so let’s dispense with the fantasies<br />
of gentle zephyr breezes and canopies or whatever.<br />
’Cause what’s the fucking point of living in Xanadu<br />
when living with yourself is the last thing that you plan to do?<br />
I guess that feeling nothing is all that you really wanted.<br />
(I told you, I know I’m not the only one that’s haunted.)<br />
I guess we’re not so different, you and I:<br />
compounding our emotional interest until it’s do or die.<br />
But whereas you decided on taking the latter,<br />
I’m’a fake it for a decade then I’m breaking the pattern.</p>
<p>And that’s the only promise that I’m making to you, dead man.</p>
