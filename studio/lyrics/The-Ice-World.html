    <h1>
The Ice World
</h1>
    
    

<p>You let the tears flow. They turn to icicles before they even hit your chin.<br />
It’s seven years though; you’d think somewhere along the line I’d learn to let you in.</p>
<p>But I’m a ice king! My crystal castle keeps me safe above the noisy scrum.<br />
It ain’t a nice thing. I tell you, heavy hangs the crown that makes my brain go numb.</p>
<p>I see you sliding down, scrabbling for purchase on the glaciers that comprise my face.<br />
I know you’re frightened now, but there’s no escape for either of us from this place.</p>
<p>So feel your best intentions frosting up your throat. You make a bid for my attention, better pack your coat.<br />
Did I neglect to mention that you’d have to cross my moat? So bring your skates too.<br />
Chill in my antechamber here until I’m ready to face you.</p>
<p>So here I come now.<br />
Soon we’ll finally see if your petition actually gets through to me somehow.<br />
Or if we’ll be stuck in this position till your face turns blue as these walls that are cold and hard as sapphire glass.<br />
I f-f-fractaled them into being in an instant.<br />
Now I shuffle in, shoulders hunched, our eyes meet…<br />
and a single drop of water falls to land at my feet.</p>
