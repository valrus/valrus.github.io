    <h1>
        Marco Stink
    </h1>
    
    <p>He’s Marco Stink!<br />
He hits dingers!<br />
He has six legs!<br />
He has no stinger!<br />
When he rounds the bases, his smell still lingers!<br />
He learned a few things about theft from his friend Best, the fresh left-winger!</p>
<p>What!<br />
There goes that bug again!<br />
He can’t really smile, but he’s looking smug again<br />
As he tags home plate, and gives me a hug again!<br />
Well, I guess that I can call that bug a friend!</p>
<p>I didn’t know what to expect when he swappet in from the Steaks.<br />
None of us really knew if that bug had what it takes<br />
To be a Breath Mint and a comrade, in that little jester hat.<br />
But then he hit a double in his first at-bat!</p>
<p>Well, in the dugout, we all shared a look and said a “thank you” for the weather.<br />
And then the bleachers shook as we shouted together:</p>
<p>We love that bug!<br />
Yeah, he hits just like a dream!<br />
We love that bug!<br />
And we’re glad he’s on the team!<br />
Even if he smells a bit like sour cream!</p>
<p>Well, I taught Marco how to steal when the dingers don’t go through.<br />
And I told him: as a bug, it’s not illegal for you.<br />
And he said, “What’s illegal!” and I started to explain,<br />
And he said, “What’s illegal with you!” That bug got me again!</p>
<p>But I don’t mind when he leaves shells around the place.<br />
And I’ve learned how to tell when there’s a smile on his face.<br />
Like when he feels that bat connect, and he knows he gets to run.<br />
Yeah, he taught me that living in this hell can still be fun.<br />
So if — by flame, or tooth, or something worse — I have to go away,<br />
The main thing I hope is that he’s okay.</p>
<p>Cause I love that bug, and the joy that’s in his game.<br />
Yeah, I asked the whole damn team and they all feel the same.<br />
(Now, they all express themselves differently, but I know them well enough to read between the lines, and what they all <em>basically</em> said was…)</p>
<p>We love that bug!<br />
And that bug loves eating seeds!<br />
We love that bug!<br />
And we know just what he needs!<br />
He needs to run around the bases at top speed!</p>
<p>We love that bug!<br />
Yeah, he’s just a little guy!<br />
We love that bug!<br />
But he hits ’em to the sky!<br />
With a team like this, <a href="/2021/09/06/The_Breath_Mints">the Mints will never die!</a></p>
