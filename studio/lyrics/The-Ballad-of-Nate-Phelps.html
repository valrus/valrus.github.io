    <h1>
The Ballad of Nate Phelps
</h1>
    
    

<p>You wanna trod upon it like it’s only a stone in your path.<br />
You can’t control it, but it’s only a hole in the math.<br />
You’re inconsolable and wholly alone in your wrath:<br />
I’m told it’s a laugh!</p>
<p>I’m flying high, I’m gonna take what you gave me and say<br />
my goodbyes when I make my escape in a day.<br />
You try to hide the fact that faith is a game that you play.<br />
The aim is to say<br />
how much more righteous you can be than the plebians.<br />
We’d begin by setting up our signs on the median.<br />
You’d be castigating anyone who had a different opinion,<br />
and meanwhile, we, your minions,<br />
inwardly reliving every beating immediately succeeding the teeniest disobedience<br />
and secretly pleading for lenience,<br />
our demeanors in appearance like furious demons<br />
(but really merely in adherence to your meaningless theories):<br />
we’d scream along in allegiance.</p>
<p>I dreamt I was a soul facing down your picket line,<br />
standing unbowed as if held upright by a second spine.<br />
And I saw your mouth move, but the words were misaligned,<br />
Just sending me peace of mind.</p>
