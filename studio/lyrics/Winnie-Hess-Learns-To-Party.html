    <h1>
        Winnie Hess (Learns To Party)
    </h1>
    
    <p>When I first came to <a
href="https://www.blaseball.wiki/w/Kansas_City_FreshDome">The
Meadow</a>, I was terrified.<br />
I couldn’t hide my fear<br />
of the toothy smile of <a
href="https://www.blaseball.wiki/w/Max_Betmint">the manager</a>,<br />
and the <a href="https://www.blaseball.wiki/w/The_Spearmint">round thing
with the spear</a>.</p>
<p>The team made no sense to me at all:<br />
<a href="https://www.blaseball.wiki/w/Eduardo_Ingram">an angel</a> with
a <a href="https://www.blaseball.wiki/w/Leach_Ingram">skeleton
wife</a>,<br />
a <a href="https://www.blaseball.wiki/w/Marquez_Clark">vampire</a> and a
<a href="https://www.blaseball.wiki/w/Oscar_Vaughan">dentist</a> and a
<a href="https://www.blaseball.wiki/w/Eizabeth_Guerra">baker</a><br />
and a <a href="https://www.blaseball.wiki/w/Whit_Steakknife">guy whose
head was a knife</a>.</p>
<p>But they were nice to me when they didn’t have to be.<br />
I could barely hold a ball, and I couldn’t really pitch at all.<br />
But I decided then and there that I would get us a ring.<br />
And I knew, deep in my glue, that I would do anything.<br />
I’d do anything.</p>
<p>But how do you get better at this game? It’s not from practice!<br />
From the very start, I think the Breath Mints understood this.<br />
And I got used to their ways, but when I was new, my goodness,<br />
the Mints’ approach to training sometimes seemed a little tactless.</p>
<p>That skeleton, Leach Ingram, would show up two hours late<br />
and just blow kisses from the mound down to her husband at the
plate.<br />
And <a href="https://www.blaseball.wiki/w/Hewitt_Best">Hewitt Best</a>
kept handing out these pamphlets at first base,<br />
and Marquez Clark the vampire always called my fastball “extreme
pace?”</p>
<p>I asked Boyfriend Monreal just why the Mints did things this
way,<br />
and they said…</p>
<p>“You wonderful horse,<br />
we’d like to win, of course,<br />
and if winning’s what you want, I know that you’ll be a star.</p>
<p>But besides the umps and the gods —<br />
who we don’t trust — there’s only us,<br />
so what’s important to the Breath Mints is to be who we are.”</p>
<p>I stopped by Izzie’s bakery and said “I think I’m in love.”<br />
And she said, “Honey, welcome to the club.”</p>
<p>I thought about what Boyfriend said for months.<br />
I realized I didn’t know who I was supposed to be.<br />
But you only ever really have a crisis like that once,<br />
and soon I learned the type of lesson that you never learn for free:</p>
<p>The umps killed Whit,<br />
the knife guy who I’d since learned was a father.<br />
And just a few weeks later they killed Leach’s Eddie too.<br />
And just as some of us were starting to recover,<br />
we had to watch our Boyfriend burn before anyone was ready to.</p>
<p>So amid the smoking remnants of their body — and our playoff run
—<br />
I finally came to grips<br />
with what I really want when the day is done,<br />
and the next could be my last if I should play in an eclipse.</p>
<p>I want to win.</p>
<p>I just want to win!<br />
I want to embrace my friends in triumph!<br />
I want to send the other team home in shame!<br />
I want it so bad, it’s even in my name!</p>
<p>I want to win!<br />
I want to pitch a single perfect game!<br />
Then if any given day I should die in flame,<br />
at least I’d go out happy.</p>
<p>And something weird happened in season 8.<br />
We were bottom of the league, but I felt great.<br />
And Leach started wilding out in the bullpen<br />
like she was on her motorcycle with Eddie again.</p>
<p>Yeah, she was having the time of her life,<br />
but she was off in a world of her own.<br />
But I wanted to go there!<br />
I wanted to know what she saw!</p>
<p>’Cause when she came to, something had changed inside her.<br />
She was kind of serene, with more control of her slider.<br />
And I begged her to tell me how she did it.<br />
She pulled out a joint, and she lit it, and she said,</p>
<p>“Iunno.”</p>
<p>So I guessed I’d have to figure it out on my own.<br />
I took a Honeycrisp and got my hair dyed roan.<br />
I tried meditation until I lost my patience,<br />
and I tried imagining my team’s congratulations,<br />
and I felt something.<br />
I pictured a standing ovation, and I felt something.<br />
I thought of my friends, and the smiles on their faces, and I saw…</p>
<p>“…but, one run against Winnie Hess is sometimes as hard as ten…”</p>
<p>“…and, Winnie Hess, over at the Breath Mints…”<br />
“Winnie Hess.”<br />
“…absolute <em>monsters</em> this year!”<br />
“It’s a massive horse. It’s a really big horse.”</p>
<p>“…I’m not sure if it’s going to be a high scoring game! ’Cause Winnie
Hess is going to lock down whoever they’re pitching aginst…”</p>
<p>“…and Winnie Hess closes out a perfect game in game one…”</p>
<p>“…but personally, I feel like the champion for season 22 was Breath
Mints pitcher Winnie Hess…”</p>
<p>“…and it is the Breath Mints who win, to become the season 22
champions. So… Breath Mints good?…”</p>
<p>“…the Kansas City Breath Mints, you have won your first Internet
Series championship, here in season 22. Wow!…”</p>
<p>And when I came to, everyone was standing around me.<br />
Their smiles were just like I remembered.<br />
I guess that Leach had told them how bad I wanted this,<br />
and so they came and found me.</p>
<p>I guess they’ll always come and find me<br />
when I get lost inside my head.<br />
And when we’re losing, and I’m chasing down those visions,<br />
I know they’ll be behind me.</p>
<p>So maybe someday I will pitch a perfect game.<br />
And maybe someday I can get us a ring.<br />
And maybe someday I’ll be killed in an inferno.<br />
But I’ll always be a Breath Mint, all the same.</p>
