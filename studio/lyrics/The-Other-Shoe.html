    <h1>
The Other Shoe
</h1>
    
    

<p>Something awful’s gonna happen to me,<br />
I don’t know if I’m gonna be ready for it.<br />
’Cause fortune swings like a pendulum in a clock<br />
about to upend and knock me into a deep pit.<br />
So I know that trouble brews,<br />
but I don’t know when or why or how or much less what I’ll do.<br />
So I just hope for subtle clues<br />
as I shudder in my shoes and wait for the bloody news, and I wonder:<br />
What’ll it be?<br />
When’s it gonna hit me?<br />
And why does it seem like my mind can never get free?</p>
<p>It all started last week when I had a windfall.<br />
I gave it all to charity to try to forestall<br />
the other shoe dropping like a medicine ball on my skull!<br />
I think the world is ready to pour all its troubles upon me,<br />
but it’s not like I’m Gandhi,<br />
who can bear the weight of so heavy a fate!<br />
I hate the feeling good graces only mean I’m in trouble now.<br />
When life is dealing aces I’m scared to double down.<br />
It’s unappealing how my face is locked in a subtle frown,<br />
I’m thinking about peeling out for new places or another town.<br />
But I can’t evade it!<br />
If the piper wants a bribe it’s too high to have paid it.<br />
But I’ve made it through this kind of cycle often before.<br />
The hard heart of life’ll soften and even the score.<br />
So I stifle coughing and it’s into the breach once more:<br />
the dice’ll drop and then, my friends, I will know what is in store.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>Something’s always going to happen to me,<br />
I don’t know if I’ll ever be ready for it.<br />
But fortune springs right back when it smacks me down:<br />
before it’s back around, it always lets me rally a little bit.</p>
