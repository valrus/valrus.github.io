    <h1>
        Mooney Doctor II
    </h1>
    
    <p>The light from the stadium takes three whole seconds to get
here<br />
Three seconds in which I’m the loneliest person alive<br />
I queue up the pitches and load them all into the railgun, one by
one<br />
And hope that they’re not too embarrassing when they arrive</p>
<p>And all the machinery murmurs its comforting updates<br />
Immaculate steel I maintain like a surrogate body<br />
I don’t know what half of it does, but I can’t stand the static and
fuzz<br />
that keeps me from hearing my friends on the team when reception is
spotty</p>
<p>Asynchronous transfers and chat rooms at night<br />
The pull of the game on a satellite<br />
But nothing can touch me as long as I’m safely out here</p>
<p>When the ump attacks I see it coming from hundreds of thousands of
miles away<br />
I rotate my railgun minutely and toggle a switch<br />
And when it’s all over my feed shows a smoldering crater on the
field<br />
And my Breath Mints all cheering me on from the edge of the ditch</p>
<p>I don’t know if what I just did was allowed<br />
But I hope that it made Hewitt proud<br />
And I hope he beats that ump’s ass when they meet in the hall</p>
<p>The seasons drag on in increasing resentment and chaos<br />
They gave me a bat, it makes even less sense than before<br />
And my fortress of solitude’s starting to feel like a prison<br />
And I’m feeling the lack of real human contact more and more</p>
<p>I steal all the steel chairs and then I just toss them aside<br />
A tantrum I throw to feel tangible down on the diamond<br />
As the fields and the skies get more crowded I can’t disguise feeling
like how did I end up here all disconnected and echoing down these cold
hallways so far from the game that I’m technically playing but also
completely alone and forever outside it</p>
<p>So when the cruel flame arcs from the indifferent dark once
again<br />
On its way from blasting all my fastest friends<br />
I think about the Hall and if I’ll see them all in the flesh<br />
Or whatever we have then<br />
And I let it happen</p>
