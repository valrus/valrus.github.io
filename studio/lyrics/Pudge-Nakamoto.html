        Pudge Nakamoto
    </h1>
    
    <p>Pudge Nakamoto is new to the game.<br />
He just appeared in the spot where your favorite star had been enveloped in flame.<br />
So if anyone asks you, “Where the hell’d our Boyfriend go?”<br />
Just introduce them to their new best friend, Pudge Nakamoto.</p>
<p>Pudge doesn’t know what to do with a bat,<br />
And refuses to learn, so there’s not very much anyone can really do about that.<br />
But you don’t have to improve, and you don’t have to grow<br />
If you can just chill and eat pancakes with your best friend, Pudge Nakamoto.</p>
<p>Now Pudge does make a mean pancake, it must be said.<br />
But it still won’t be more than a couple of seasons before you end up wanting him dead.</p>
<p>’Cause Pudge Nakamoto is shaped like a friend.<br />
He’s cute and he’s fat and his time as your leadoff bat will never come to an end.<br />
So if you had dreams of a team with a championship in a season or two,<br />
Your brand new best friend Pudge Nakamoto will make sure they never come true.</p>
