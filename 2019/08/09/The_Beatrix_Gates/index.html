    <h1>SPL Book Bingo 2: The Beatrix Gates</h1>

/> </span></p>
<p>This is the second in a series of posts about books I read for
Seattle Public Library’s <a
href="https://www.spl.org/programs-and-services/learning/summer-of-learning/2019-adult-book-bingo">Book
Bingo</a>. For the “Challenges your world view” square, I read <em>The
Beatrix Gates</em>, by Rachel Pollack.</p>
<p>Content warning: <em>The Beatrix Gates</em> is very heavy on issues
of transgender identity. That’s not the content warning, hold your
horses. The content warning is that I’m a cis man and I’m going to write
about transgender issues in the process of discussing this book. I’m
100% supportive of the right of everyone to live as their chosen gender
or to reject the gender binary entirely, so I’m not going to be coming
in hot with some bigoted shit here, and I think my understanding of how
to talk about gender stuff respectfully is reasonably solid. But I’m
still cis and I haven’t lived it; I may slip up, and even if I don’t,
probably any thoughts I have will be
<a href="/assets/images/posts/The_Beatrix_Gates/talking_about_gender.jpg" rel="bytebox">
101-level </a> and it’s best to consider my audience to be other cis
people.</p>
<p>Technically the book I read is titled “<em>The Beatrix Gates,
Plus…</em>” as it contains the title story and two others, as well as a
nonfiction personal essay, <em>Trans Central Station</em>, and an
interview with the author. But I want to talk about the title story
first.</p>
<p>My main exposure to trans people has been on the social network
Mastodon, which is a relatively accepting internet space and so
attracted lots of folks who wanted to get away from all the Nazis that
Twitter happily embraces telling them they ought to be holocausted or
whatever Nazis like to say these days. <em>The Beatrix Gates</em> has a
vibe that I’ve seen from some people on Mastodon and which I can only
describe, approvingly, as “trans supremacy.”<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">I know that, especially with all the aforementioned
Nazis that seem to be around these days, “supremacy” is a loaded term.
But I don’t think “trans supremacy” is a problem like white supremacy
is, for basically the same reason that I don’t think “punching up” is a
problem in comedy. In fact I think it’s a great thing for marginalized
people not to settle for the scraps the majority is willing to throw to
them, or for merely being regarded as human in the way that the majority
takes for granted, but to recast the things they’re marginalized for as
strengths and celebrate them.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>The running theme of trans supremacy, which I should re-emphasize
that I made up, is that trans people confront and seize control of their
own biology— even if they don’t medically transition — in a way that cis
people generally don’t even contemplate. I’ve generally been ambivalent
about my gender — American masculinity has a whole lot of problems I
don’t want to cozy up to — but still, while reading Mastodon recently, I
was struck by the realization that at the age of 36 I’d never asked
myself: <em>am</em> I actually a man? I’m pretty sure the answer is yes,
but the point is how long it took me to ask. Trans people can’t live on
gender autopilot in the way that I did for most of my life. They have to
wrestle with the question of how to live authentically in the bodies
they were born with, or change those bodies to better align with how
they feel. I’ve seen trans people on Mastodon who seem to have struggled
with that and, at least somewhat, overcome it, and it seems like that
struggle made them more comfortable in their skin than most cis people I
know.</p>
<p>In <em>Trans Central Station</em>, Rachel Pollack devotes a couple of
pages to looking at how the meaning of the prefix “trans-” pertains to
transgender experience in some other words in which it appears:
transport, transparent, transmission, and so on. But one she leaves out,
and which seems most relevant to <em>The Beatrix Gates</em>, is
<em>transcendence</em>. <em>The Beatrix Gates</em> asks: if trans people
are able to transcend their assigned gender, what else might they be
able to transcend? It answers: how about <em>mortality?</em> This
passage, which encapsulates my idea of trans supremacy as well as any
I’ve seen, explains how this came to be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The nons—the non-transsexuals… wanted their nan-o-ma-chines
<em>[sic]</em> to make them <em>better</em>, to cure their sicknesses
and keep them young, and make everyone pretty, but not
<em>different</em>. They didn’t want to stop being who they were, or
thought they were, to become seriously new.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That notion of embracing technology to become something new seems to
draw a lot of trans people to cyberpunk, which although it’s usually
dystopian is also incredibly rich with possibility for body
modification. But <em>The Beatrix Gates</em> isn’t a cyberpunk story;
instead, its central story of how its trans people achieved immortality
takes up about half its length and is told as a sort of fairy tale or
parable. This, along with a looser theme of mortality, seems to be the
thread that unites <em>Gates</em> and the two other stories that make up
this micro-compilation. <em>The Woman Who Didn’t Come Back</em> is fully
framed as a myth explaining how women had and then lost a kind of
immortality, or at least a second life. <em>Burning Beard</em> is a
retelling of the Biblical story of Joseph, at the end of his life and
remembering how his divine visions have shaped it. They’re fine enough
stories but I didn’t get a lot out of them. As well, Pollack’s
apparently longstanding expertise in shamanism and the Tarot which she
discusses in <em>Trans Central Station</em> didn’t really have an impact
on me; her somewhat brief and superficial treatment of it made me feel
like there was background knowledge I needed to have in order to
understand its import.</p>
<p>So I think the real draw here is Rachel Pollack’s thoughts about what
it means to be transgender in <em>The Beatrix Gates</em> and <em>Trans
Central Station</em>. She acknowledges the struggle to be recognized and
accepted but presents being trans as much more than that struggle; she
reflects on history but, through science fiction, gives us powerful
visions of a future as well. This book is a quick read, and I’d
recommend it to just about anyone, but particularly to cis people open
to a different perspective on engaging with gender. I couldn’t find a
way to fit it into the above, but I’ll leave you with this quote, which
struck me the most as a cis person:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the wrong language, one of strict categories and confinement,
the world becomes a fake, a stage set whose actors don’t know they are
in a play… Most people do not notice this becaue their own sense of
self, of language, more or less fits the received version of existence.
They still suffer, for in a world of strict and very limited categories
they must constantly check themselves against the model of a “real man”
or a “real woman.” The ones who reveal the fake are the ones who simply
cannot make themselves fit.</p>
