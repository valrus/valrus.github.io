<p>This is the sixth in my series of posts about books I read for
Seattle Public Library’s 2019 <a
href="https://www.spl.org/programs-and-services/learning/summer-of-learning/2019-adult-book-bingo">Book
Bingo</a>, which ended on September 3rd; I did get a bingo, but
neglected to submit the card before the deadline. Whoops! Anyway, for
the “by an author of color” square, I read <em>The Fire Next Time</em>,
by James Baldwin.</p>
<p>I was inspired to read this book by the track “<a
href="https://genius.com/Jamila-woods-baldwin-lyrics">BALDWIN</a>” off
Jamila Woods’s excellent album <a
href="https://jamilawoodsmusic.bandcamp.com/album/legacy-legacy"><em>LEGACY!
LEGACY!</em></a> and the <a
href="http://songexploder.net/jamila-woods">episode of the Song Exploder
podcast</a> where she explained how she wrote it. Woods had an <a
href="https://pitchfork.com/features/song-by-song/jamila-woods-legacy-legacy-interview/">interview
with Pitchfork</a> which echoed much of her explanation in the Song
Exploder ep:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He talks about white people, and how they don’t always see us as
human—but he’s saying, These innocent people, we have to accept them
with love. The way Baldwin talks about love is so complex, and it’s
always an active choice, but that was always the part of the letter
where I was like, Really? It seems very difficult to accept all of these
people with love. Accept Dante Servin and [George] Zimmerman with love?
That’s a lot, James.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book <em>The Fire Next Time</em> consists of a pair of letters,
“My Dungeon Shook: Letter to My Nephew on the One Hundredth Anniversary
of the Emancipation” and “Down At The Cross: Letter from a Region in My
Mind.” A version of the former, which differs a bit from the one in
<em>The Fire Next Time</em>, can be read <a
href="https://progressive.org/magazine/letter-nephew/">at the
Progressive</a>.</p>
<p>If I had a hard time writing about <em><a
href="/2018/08/30/No_One_Will_See_Me_Cry/index.html">No One Will See Me
Cry</a></em> or <em><a href="/2018/08/02/Hybrid_Child/index.html">Hybrid
Child</a></em> because they were kind of oblique and non-linear, I had
no such problem with <em>The Fire Next Time</em>. Baldwin’s prose is
elegant and straightforward, simultaneously merciless in his clear-eyed
indictment of white America and merciful in his ultimate refusal to let
that indictment become fuel for hatred. This book is challenging to
write about in a different way: if there are hidden or subtle meanings
to be teased out here, I — as a white man conversant with but not
steeped in American racial inequality — am not the best person to do so.
So this will be more a personal reaction to what I read than an analysis
of it.</p>
<p>That disclaimer in mind, something that struck me about <em>The Fire
Next Time</em> was how extremely (and refreshingly) not written for a
white audience it seemed to be. White mistreatment of black people is
axiomatic; Baldwin doesn’t cite statistics or relate anecdotes in an
attempt to convince anyone of what he knows to be true. By giving up
that defensiveness, he’s able to cover a lot of ground in these hundred
or so pages, about the consequences of American racism and what it will
take to change it.</p>
<p>The first letter, “My Dungeon Shook,” which occupies only about ten
percent of the book, is explicitly addressed to Baldwin’s nephew.
Despite that, it does serve a sort of introductory role for white
readers like myself: <em>This is how it is for us as black people in
America; I’m trying to save my nephew’s life, so don’t expect me to
sugar-coat it.</em> It’s a bracing and uncomfortable read; ultimately,
as well, a hopeful one, but not in a way that will let white readers off
the hook. Baldwin doesn’t offer easy solutions or the glib
slate-cleaning that many white people seem to hope for. His promise to
his nephew is that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we with love shall force our brothers to see themselves as they are,
to cease fleeing from reality and begin to change it,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and he must have known, over 50 years ago, what we see now: that this
would be an arduous process and white people would by and large be
dragged into reality only kicking and screaming<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">Tangentially related, here in 2019 is <a
href="https://afroculinaria.com/2019/08/09/dear-disgruntled-white-plantation-visitors-sit-down/">Michael
Twitty</a> responding eloquently to some of that kicking and
screaming.<br />
<br />
</span></span>.</p>
<p>“Down at the Cross,” which occupies the vast majority of the book,
likewise makes very few concessions to any imagined white reader. Again
Baldwin is able to write with great candor about his experience, his
knowledge about the treatment of black people in general at the hands of
whites, and about the Nation of Islam movement that that treatment gave
rise to. When he spells out the prophesy of the white man’s inevitable
doom that gives the prophet Elijah Muhammad and his Nation of Islam
followers their hope, their influence and their power, we sense that
Baldwin is tempted by it. When his retelling of that prophesy culminates
in their conclusion that “the sword they have used so long against
others can now, without mercy, be used against them,” we sense his hand
half-reaching for the hilt. And after he steps back from that tale into
his own life — where he once fled a different church, in part, because
of a similar bloody-minded division of the world into <em>us</em>, the
saved, and <em>them</em>, the damned — the rest of his meeting with
Elijah and his subsequent trip across the city to meet with some white
friends feels like a kind of long exhalation of a breath caught in
acknowledgement of the power of Elijah’s story.</p>
<p>When Baldwin is spinning on the impossibility of convincing Elijah
that white people don’t, perhaps, deserve wholesale annihilation, he
feels a moment of kinship with the conscious white people he’s come to
know:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the eeriest way possible, I suddenly had a glimpse of what white
people must go through at a dinner table when they are trying to prove
that Negroes are not subhuman. I had almost said, after all, “Well, take
my friend Mary,” and very nearly descended to a catalogue of those
virtues that gave Mary the right to be alive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s characteristic of the charity and compassion Baldwin displays
throughout <em>The Fire Next Time</em>, of his empathy and his refusal
to let the long and bloody history of white people’s aggression entirely
cloud his view of their humanity. One wishes that white people were
generally better at reciprocating that empathy; making this book
required reading in high school would be a good step along that path,
but failing that, it’s never too late to start. I can’t think of a
person to whom I wouldn’t recommend this book.</p>
