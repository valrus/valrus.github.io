&lt;p&gt;If my web page has a “readership,” it is completely opaque to me — I
have no analytics, no comments, nothing telling me I’m not chucking this
effort directly into a Null Vortex — and this page in particular is not
one that would reward repeat visits. So like. Who will know? Why
bother?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/2024/07/22/ai&#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; asked this question too,
and didn’t really have a satisfying answer. It was like: maybe I’m
contributing in some minute measure to the much-vaunted (in some
circles) “&lt;a href=&#34;https://smallweb.page/home&#34;&gt;small web&lt;/a&gt;?” I guess?
But that’s not really why I did the work I did (and it was work) over
the weekend. And I want a better answer about what’s motivating me these
days. So I’m going to dump some thoughts into a list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type=&#34;1&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay so I read &lt;a
href=&#34;https://bookshop.org/p/books/how-to-do-nothing-resisting-the-attention-economy-jenny-odell/8076119&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How
to Do Nothing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Jenny Odell recently so I just sort of had
doing nothing on the brain. Updating my web page was not &lt;em&gt;doing
nothing&lt;/em&gt; doing nothing, but it is doing a kind of nothing in the
sense that I understand Odell to mean it: no one is making any money off
my web page (notwithstanding the infinitesimal value it’s surely
providing to AI scrapers, but I’m trying to be positive for once in my
life here) and in its own small way it sits in opposition to the
“attention economy” if only because probably no one is paying any
attention to it. So there was just kind of fertile psychological ground
for doing some like… tilling? I don’t know, I’m not a gardener, but you
get what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright. I lied when I said &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; is paying attention
to my web page. But how do I even know? Well, what happened was someone
boosted &lt;a href=&#34;https://kayserifserif.place/&#34;&gt;Katherine Yang&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a
href=&#34;https://sunny.garden/@kayserifserif/114268711259377892&#34;&gt;Mastodon
post&lt;/a&gt; about her &lt;a href=&#34;https://tree.kayserifserif.place/&#34;&gt;In The
Year of a Tree&lt;/a&gt; into my timeline and I was like: Hey that looks like
my thing! (It’s not &lt;em&gt;my thing&lt;/em&gt; really, Katherine started hers
first and even if she didn’t I got the idea from a book, but like,
&lt;em&gt;this instance&lt;/em&gt; of it that I did is mine) And so I replied to it
like: Hey I love this! It’s like my thing but better!&lt;span
class=&#34;sidenote-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-0&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-0&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span
class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the Year of a Tree&lt;/em&gt; is, objectively, better.
The pictures are better, the presentation is better, the tree changes
more interestingly than my evergreens. But I’m actually really happy
with mine for what it is, which is a document of time well spent doing
nothing. The fixity of the evergreens helps convey the full extent of
the nothing I’m doing. The fact that the pictures are kind of shitty
makes it more about the repetition and the practice than the aesthetics.
I like that &lt;em&gt;In the Year of a Tree&lt;/em&gt; has the same ugly rooftop in
every picture. It’s aesthetically interesting to have the hard lines
against the lush or spindly organics of the tree, but it also conveys a
similarly approachable sense of just working with what’s there rather
than being too fussy or artsy about it. Letting the tree do the
talking.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And she replied like “lovely!” and said enough more
specific stuff that I can confidently say that at least &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt;
person has paid attention to my web page, at least once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m trying not to edit this post a lot but I did write and then
delete a mediocre joke about, like, “attention economy, here I come!”
before I thought: No, actually, this is a real thing. Having made this
little project and put it on my web site did really enable this sweet
moment of connection with a total stranger about a similar non-effortful
effort we made to observe and appreciate and maybe see a little more or
deeply at least &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; than we might in the attention
economy that Jenny Odell would have us resist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so but then shortly after that I got an email out of the blue
from someone appreciating my Sit Spot page, and I’m kind of reluctant to
mention this one but I found their blog and read some of it and sent
them an email back about some of the stuff on it and never got a reply,
and it was kind of like a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; email I got a while back
from someone claiming to have been following my (very sporadic and also
largely disregarded) &lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/studio&#34;&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; for a long time and
expressing appreciation for a particular old song of mine, and I replied
enthusiastically and never heard back from &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; either, and so
in both cases I was like: Was this even real? Is someone running a bot
that like finds people’s websites and AI-generates nice emails to send
them? Because that’s sort of a nice idea but also kind of shitty in
execution if the person is looking for an actual connection with a
human, and in both cases I felt like kind of a dupe for actually
replying in the hopes of getting that, so it’s weird and embarrassing
and vulnerable to even include this, but I can’t deny that it did
contribute to my wanting to give my web page a little love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really haven’t been posting here a lot in, like, the last
several years. Part of it is that I always feel like a blog post has to
be a big production for whatever reason. Small things I can just throw
on Mastodon, which doesn’t generally feel shitty to use, even though it
&lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have that gross attention-economy social-media little
engagement dopamine hit thing going on, but at least that does mean that
my posts are actually reaching other humans. But it’s all so
&lt;em&gt;transient&lt;/em&gt;. I can go back and read my feed, and sometimes I do
because I think I’m funny, and that’s fine. But my web site feels like
an &lt;em&gt;edifice&lt;/em&gt;, you know? I’ve been updating it, even if only at a
glacial pace at times, for over a decade. It means that at this point I
feel like additions to it need to be &lt;em&gt;worthy&lt;/em&gt; of inclusion, even
though some of &lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/2013/08/06/Python_Cuddles&#34;&gt;my earliest
posts&lt;/a&gt; are really just unnecessarily verbose Mastodon toots. But so
as a whole, I’m proud of it, and I want to make more blog posts to
contribute to the edifice, but it always seems like so much
&lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;, and do I actually even have anything worth putting that
much effort into saying? If I have an idea for a little improvement to a
random buried page that I know one or possibly even two people have
looked at, even if they don’t look at it again, it’s still a way to kind
of keep in touch with my website. Like, hey bud. I know I haven’t done a
real post in a while. But I still care about you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At work I do Professional Software Developer shit. Unit,
functional, integration AND end-to-end tests. Minimum Viable Products.
“Built on AWS.” Observability. Scalability. I get why it’s all important
for trying to do a thing that a lot of people depend on in some way. And
it’s kind of interesting, in its own way. But a cursory look at my
personal programming projects is enough to see it’s not the scale that I
would choose to work at, if I could do whatever I wanted. It doesn’t
feel to me like &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt;, which, I mean, fair enough, it’s work,
but I did get into this profession in 2013 or whatever because I thought
this could be fun. I don’t think what I do for work now is fun, mostly.
But hand-coding a website and the tool I use to build it, with no
stakes? That’s still fun. Maybe it’s a kind of nostalgia, which I’m
deeply suspicious of but susceptible to nonetheless. Or maybe it really
is just all about the fact that there’s no pressure, no one asking
anything of me, just me taking a thing that’s mine and making it a
little better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediate follow-up question, which you may not be asking but which I
want to try to answer regardless: why post about it? When I’m so
confident that if anyone ever actually reads my site I’ll never know
about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, a couple days after the tweaks I just finished exhaustively
cataloguing my motivations for, I came across this &lt;a
href=&#34;https://www.experimental-history.com/p/28-slightly-rude-notes-on-writing&#34;&gt;wonderful
essay&lt;/a&gt; about writing and it made me miss writing prose like I write
code for my website: not really for anyone (but it’s cool if someone
sees it and lets me know somehow), certainly not because anything
&lt;em&gt;depends&lt;/em&gt; on it, but just… I don’t know, exactly. For some of the
reasons articulated in that essay, like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing is a costly signal of caring about something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, perhaps, if I wanted to make this a sort of sequel to my &lt;a
href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/2024/07/22/ai&#34;&gt;last blog post&lt;/a&gt;, over nine months ago,
because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It used to be that our only competitors were made of carbon. Now some
of our competitors are made out of silicon. New competition should make
us better at competing—this is our chance to be more thoughtful about
writing than we’ve ever been before. No system can optimize for
everything, so what are our minds optimized for, and how can I double
down on &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;? How can I go even deeper into the territory where
the machines fear to tread, territories that I only notice
&lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they’re treacherous for machines?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is it that I want to expensively signal that I care about?
What is it I hope to double down on? The word that keeps bobbing to the
surface of my brain, even after I push it down to see if I can make room
for anything else to float up, is &lt;em&gt;interiority&lt;/em&gt;: I have it, my
new silicon competitors do not, I want to double down on it, &lt;a
href=&#34;https://news.fsu.edu/news/science-technology/2025/02/17/why-does-chatgpt-delve-so-much-fsu-researchers-begin-to-uncover-why-chatgpt-overuses-certain-words/&#34;&gt;delve&lt;/a&gt;
deeper into it, make an effort to account for my own human inclinations
and desires. I don’t know if this is “where the machines fear to tread”
or if I’m being “more thoughtful about writing than… ever before” but it
feels intuitively like a promising direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t not undermine my own supposed insights or imagine being read
by my worst critic, so let me just say: I don’t really think there’s
anything &lt;em&gt;revolutionary&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;groundbreaking&lt;/em&gt; about the
concept of “&lt;a
href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/01/the-linux-of-social-media-how-livejournal-pioneered-then-lost-web-blogging/&#34;&gt;journaling
in public&lt;/a&gt;.” But in 2025 it feels like something worth re-affirming
the value of, even if only to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;It’s Not “AI”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so first off: I don’t even like to refer to the recent in-vogue
text and image generation tools as “AI.” I think it’s a poorly-defined
term that is used more to evoke associations in people’s brains than to
be an accurate representation of the technology we have in front of us.
Throughout this rant I will refer to things like ChatGPT as “LLMs,” for
“Large Language Models.” Because if LLMs are AI, so is autocorrect on
your phone. So is every other “chat bot” that uses keyword matching to
try to direct you to a website’s help pages to run interference on
letting you talk to a human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;its-boosters-are-misanthropic&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Its Boosters Are Misanthropic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/assets/images/posts/ChatGPT/stochastic-parrots-2.png&#34;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These quotes are a reference to a 2021 paper&lt;span
class=&#34;sidenote-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-0&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-0&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span

https://doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445922&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; about LLMs. In it, its co-authors Emily Bender and Timnit
Gebru define “stochastic parrot” thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…an LM is a system for haphazardly stitching together sequences of
linguistic forms it has observed in its vast training data, according to
probabilistic information about how they combine, but without any
reference to meaning: a stochastic parrot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context, what Altman is saying is clear: when you have
thoughts and feelings and use them to express yourself with language,
all you’re &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; doing is putting one word in front of another
in a way that’s probabilistically consistent with the vast amount of
other language you’ve been exposed to in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s some text I probabilistically generated with Sam Altman’s
claims and the definition of “stochastic parrot” as input: not only is
this wrong, it fucking sucks, and I hate it. I know it is wrong, and I
know I hate it, because I read it and I feel disgust as a somatic
experience not unlike mild nausea, along with an involuntary twist in my
face that I have to consciously suppress and involuntary tenseness in my
muscles that I have to consciously relax. My reaction is not just the
result of neurons firing in response to linguistic entities. I feel it
in my body. And even if I don’t choose to assemble my thoughts into
words as I’m doing now, the feeling persists. What about dance? Sport?
Can these bodily experiences and all the intuition they require to
achieve be reproduced synthetically by consuming enough training
data?&lt;span
class=&#34;sidenote-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span
class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;This paragraph is a patchy, inadequate survey of a
small portion of the ground covered in Siri Hustvedt’s tremendous essay
“The Delusions of Certainty,” which can be found in her book &lt;em&gt;A Woman
Looking At Men Looking At Women&lt;/em&gt;. If you are unconvinced by my
single paragraph of rebuttal here, please read that essay and consider
how many of the delusional certainties discussed in it the
humans-as-stochastic-parrots claim rests on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate not just that Altman’s unsupported claim debases the richness
of actual human experience, but that it does so in such a transparently
self-serving way. If humans are just stochastic parrots, of course,
anything they can do can be done instead by a language model, such as
those conveniently produced by Altman’s company. This minimization of
the sophistication of human experience is the counterpart of AI
fearmongering, which posits &lt;a
href=&#34;https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-alignment-research&#34;&gt;AI as
a possible “existential risk”&lt;/a&gt; in order to make it seem more powerful
than it is. I don’t think Sam Altman really believes what he’s saying
here, but whether he does or not, it’s incredibly cynical, and it
sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Hype Sucks And It’s Encroachingly Ubiquitous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hype around LLMs has been at the level of “fever pitch” for
months that feel like years. It’s the most significant invention since
the Internet. No, since the &lt;em&gt;printing press.&lt;/em&gt; No, since
&lt;em&gt;electricity.&lt;/em&gt; No, seriously. In an &lt;a
href=&#34;https://www.henryakissinger.com/articles/chatgpt-heralds-an-intellectual-revolution/&#34;&gt;editorial
for the Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;, Henry Kissinger&lt;span
class=&#34;sidenote-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-2&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-2&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span
class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;Really? &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a
href=&#34;https://www.vox.com/2016/5/9/11640562/kissinger-pentagon-award&#34;&gt;Henry
Kissinger?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Eric Schmidt and Daniel Huttenlocher say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new technology bids to transform the human cognitive process as it
has not been shaken up since the invention of printing. The technology
that printed the Gutenberg Bible in 1455 made abstract human thought
communicable generally and rapidly. But new technology today reverses
that process. Whereas the printing press caused a profusion of modern
human thought, the new technology achieves its distillation and
elaboration. In the process, it creates a gap between human knowledge
and human understanding. If we are to navigate this transformation
successfully, new concepts of human thought and interaction with
machines will need to be developed. This is the essential challenge of
the Age of Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc Andreessen &lt;a
href=&#34;https://a16z.com/ai-will-save-the-world/&#34;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stakes here are high. The opportunities are profound. AI is quite
possibly the most important – and best – thing our civilization has ever
created, certainly on par with electricity and microchips, and probably
beyond those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t make any fucking sense! You can’t run a so-called AI
without electricity and microchips! &lt;em&gt;How can AI be more important
than the things its very existence depends on?&lt;/em&gt; But then, of course,
Andreessen is a venture capitalist who invests in these technologies. So
perhaps he’s not a wholly objective and impartial observer here. But so
because what we call a “free” country is actually largely controlled by
the whims of people like Marc Andreessen, it’s apparently become
mandatory for every company on earth to cram some “AI” functionality
that no one asked for into their already rapidly-enshittifying product,
in order to…? Attract VC funding? Get a bump in their stock price? If I
were a more inquisitive or cynical person I might have a better
understanding of whatever asinine capitalist incentives are at play
here. But we’re just coming off &lt;em&gt;yet another&lt;/em&gt; record-breaking
heatwave where I live, so I just can’t bring myself to give a shit about
capitalist incentives, because look where they’ve gotten us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the coin, now that LLMs are in the hands of The
People, they’re rapidly using them to flood the entire internet with
dubiously-accurate laundered plagiarism. The uselessness of the internet
for obtaining actual information has been intensifying for years, what
with Google gradually turning their search engine into an advertisement
delivery engine and the proliferation of SEO spam. But LLMs are going to
make this a hundred times worse. Indeed, they’re already doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;its-obsequity-is-annoying-and-its-prose-is-vapid&#34;
class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Its Obsequity Is Annoying And Its Prose Is Vapid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I wouldn’t mind seeing LLM-extruded text everywhere if it were
actually pleasant or interesting to read. But it’s not. It’s invariably
a flavorless beige paste, as dead on the page as the entity that
produced it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insofar as ChatGPT can be said to have a personality, it is
deferential to the point of obsequity. ChatGPT backs down immediately
and totally when challenged. Recently I used it to provide me an
&lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://manpages.org/rsync&#34;&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; to
transfer some files to my NAS, and it gave me a working command with no
issue. Pretty cool!&lt;span
class=&#34;sidenote-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-3&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-3&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span
class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;I never had any doubt that this would work. GPT is
trained on the internet, which is replete with nerds talking about their
nerd shit. Nerds love nothing more than to explain things. As evidence,
see: this whole-ass web site&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The network connection got interrupted, and I asked how
to resume the transfer. ChatGPT gave me another command with the
&lt;code&gt;--partial&lt;/code&gt; flag, and that worked too. Also pretty cool! Then
I told it that that the &lt;code&gt;--partial&lt;/code&gt; flag that I had just
successfully used doesn’t actually exist. It readily agreed and
“corrected” itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/assets/images/posts/ChatGPT/rsync-partial.png&#34;
title=&#34;me: &amp;quot;The `--partial flag doesn&amp;#39;t actually exist.&amp;quot; chatgpt: &amp;quot;I apologize for the incorrect information provided. You&amp;#39;re right, the --partial flag does not exist in rsync. I apologize for the confusion caused.&amp;quot;&#34;
alt=&#34;I guess ‘I apologize for the confusion caused’ could refer to ChatGPT’s.&#34; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;I guess ‘I apologize for the confusion
caused’ could refer to ChatGPT’s.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to credit ChatGPT with a lot of new or original inventions,
considering that it’s built completely off the stolen text of the actual
humans who preceded it, but it seems to have invented a new kind of
rhetorical technique which I’m pithily naming the “apology sandwich.” I
view anyone who actually &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to be groveled at like this with
extreme suspicion, but it does seem to be designed to take advantage of
&lt;a
href=&#34;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3762223&#34;&gt;our
tendency to anthromorphize&lt;/a&gt;, to lead us to think these things are
actually intelligent and even sentient. They’re not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or see &lt;a
href=&#34;http://www.briggeman.org/wordpress/posts/talking-chatgpt-with-chatgpt/&#34;&gt;this
chat&lt;/a&gt; where Jason Briggeman presses it on why it fails to generate a
limerick that scans when a poetic form with very strict and clear
parameters for meter and rhyme should be right up a piece of software’s
alley. One half expects it to respond to a correction with “pwease i am
just a smol chatbot who is twying its vewwy best.” I would almost prefer
&lt;a
href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/15/23599072/microsoft-ai-bing-personality-conversations-spy-employees-webcams&#34;&gt;Bing
Chat’s amoral, hostile intransigence&lt;/a&gt; if not for fear that it would
spawn a thousand hysterical thinkpieces about “alignment&lt;span
class=&#34;sidenote-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-4&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-4&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span
class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;“Alignment” is the term for making sure that some
imaginary sentient AI’s incentives are “aligned” with humanity’s so that
it doesn’t end up, like, launching nukes or &lt;a
href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence#Paperclip_maximizer&#34;&gt;turning
us all into paperclips&lt;/a&gt; or whatever. Pure science fiction, but that’s
the mode the kind of people who write about “alignment” want you to be
operating in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;” for every day it was allowed to continue running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;its-boosters-dont-give-a-shit-about-consent&#34;
class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Its Boosters Don’t Give A Shit About Consent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like barely a day goes by when I don’t read about some
company adding a clause to their user agreement saying they’re going to
be training LLMs on your data. This training is never opt-in. It’s
enabled by default, and it will be happening unless you (a) find out
about it and (b) wade through the inevitable thicket of &lt;a
href=&#34;https://www.deceptive.design/types/obstruction&#34;&gt;dark patterns&lt;/a&gt;
lovingly grown between you and the setting to turn it off. Assuming
there is one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course, why wouldn’t companies that use LLMs do this? &lt;a
href=&#34;https://artisticinquiry.org/AI-Open-Letter&#34;&gt;Using people’s work
without their consent&lt;/a&gt; is literally the foundation upon which LLMs
are built. So of course they’re going to see nothing wrong with silently
opting-in their users, or &lt;a
href=&#34;https://rknight.me/blog/perplexity-ai-robotstxt-and-other-questions/&#34;&gt;ignoring
decades-old web scraping conventions&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a
href=&#34;https://www.metafilter.com/204762/Taylor-and-Francis-sells-access-to-research-material-to-Microsoft-AI&#34;&gt;selling
their users’ data&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a
href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/05/openai-will-use-reddit-posts-to-train-chatgpt-under-new-deal&#34;&gt;for
LLM training&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the most important thing since electricity!
&lt;em&gt;Why do you hate progress???&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;so-what-am-i-even-fucking-doing-here&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So What Am I Even Fucking Doing Here&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Other people’s work,” in the last paragraph, includes mine, of
course:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/assets/images/posts/ChatGPT/itme.png&#34;
title=&#34;A search for my domain name in the C4 dataset used by Google to train LLMS. I have helpfully if nonconsensually provided them 17,000 tokens, one hundred thousandth of a percent of the dataset.&#34;
alt=&#34;I can see my house from here&#34; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34;&gt;I can see my house from here&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it’s like, why keep posting on the internet if these assholes
are just going to scrape it into their insatiable maw, along with a
million other actual people’s actual hard work, to be shat out in an
unrecognizable&lt;span
class=&#34;sidenote-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-5&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-5&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span
class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;(though, come to think of it, &lt;em&gt;recognizable&lt;/em&gt;
would be even worse)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; homogeneous, anodyne slurry? I don’t think I’m a
&lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; writer but I think I’m OK at it, and I can’t put my
feelings about this any better than maya, whose &lt;a
href=&#34;https://maya.land/&#34;&gt;maya.land&lt;/a&gt; is the kind of intensely unique
and flavorful and &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; old-school personal website that the
web should be aspiring to—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site has been too much of an experiment for me to claim now that
I have a grand theory about it, about similar sites – but certainly by
now I have instincts, feelings… …and making my writing available for
automated summarization? So someone can sell ads by a depersonalized
version of my stuff? The feeling is nausea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—in her incredibly relatable “&lt;a
href=&#34;https://maya.land/monologues/2023/02/14/mr-openai-i-dont-feel-so-good.html&#34;&gt;mr.
openai i don’t feel so good&lt;/a&gt;.” Or, to TL;DR the very good &lt;a
href=&#34;https://v21.io/blog/how-to-find-things-online&#34;&gt;How To Find Things
Online&lt;/a&gt;, which you should also actually R, What Even Is The Point
Anymore.&lt;span

class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; it had already been over a year since
my last blog post when ChatGPT arrived on the scene. But it’s the
&lt;em&gt;principle&lt;/em&gt; of the thing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I am engaged in the valuable, noble act of &lt;a
href=&#34;https://lmnt.me/blog/building-a-stronger-web.html&#34;&gt;Building A
Stronger Web Without AI&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe by linking to &lt;a
href=&#34;https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/archive/&#34;&gt;real humans&lt;/a&gt; using
their hard-earned brain cells to write thoughtful words on the internet,
I can help make a web that feels like a &lt;em&gt;web&lt;/em&gt;, interconnected and
constructed by individuals, one not dependent on the whims of
multi-billion-dollar advertising companies. Maybe I just want to &lt;a
href=&#34;https://wilnichols.com/dumb-thoughts-on-dumber-ai/&#34;&gt;add my
voice&lt;/a&gt; to the others saying this stuff is bad, morally and
aesthetically. Maybe since it contributed to taking away what little
wind I had in my sails for blogging in the last couple years, it seemed
only suitable that I use my first post back to slag it off. Anyway, here
you go, ChatGPT. Go tell people how much I think you suck.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I didn’t finish my Book Bingo posts — and maybe I will sometime but
maybe I won’t — but participating in Book Bingo got me back in the habit
of reading instead of aimlessly browsing the internet, at least
&lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the time. So I may continue writing about the
occasional book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confession time: even though David Foster Wallace turned out to be a
real piece of shit in a lot of ways, I still love &lt;em&gt;Infinite
Jest&lt;/em&gt;. My excuse is I read it when I was 20, possibly the ideal age
for having your mind absolutely blown by a big, indulgently maximalist
novel that’s equal parts sincere and irreverent, serious and playful.
But the book has also become shorthand for a kind of “lit-bro” mindset
that I feel defensive about whenever I mention it. In a way, I’m looking
for a new favorite book, and ideally one with less baggage (between its
covers and in the minds of people I might mention it to) than
&lt;em&gt;Infinite Jest&lt;/em&gt; has. I’m not 20 anymore so it’s unlikely that any
present-day reading will have the effect on me that &lt;em&gt;Infinite
Jest&lt;/em&gt; did. But the search is a good excuse to read daunting,
idiosyncratic, ambitious novels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ducks, Newburyport&lt;/em&gt; is one such book. It’s not, I think, my
new favorite. But it’s almost completely unlike anything I’ve ever read,
and it made me think a lot of thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me start with a run-down of the superficial, attention-getting
characteristics of &lt;em&gt;Ducks, Newburyport&lt;/em&gt; that you’ll probably
encounter immediately if you look up anything about it on the internet:
It’s almost a thousand pages long&lt;span
class=&#34;sidenote-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-0&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-0&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span
class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;A lightly bowdlerized and editorialized glossary of
abbreviations (“POS” and “POTUS” are rendered as “Piece of [Scat]” and
“Purveyor of Totally Unprecedented Sleaze,” respectively) pushes the
length over 1,000 pages.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and almost all of those pages consist of the interior
monologue of an Ohio housewife which is punctuated by the phrase “the
fact that” in lieu of any full stops besides the one on page 988.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stream of consciousness is occasionally, and relatively briefly,
broken up by more conventional prose describing the journey of a
mountain lion through the unnamed narrator’s environs. The purposeful
terseness of these sections stands in stark contrast to the
anxiety-ridden torrent of the main narrative, in the nine hundred or so
pages of which (as noted by an excellent &lt;a
href=&#34;https://www.cageclub.me/ducks-newburyport-lucy-ellmann/&#34;&gt;podcast
episode&lt;/a&gt; about the book) about four things happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to read a book like &lt;em&gt;Ducks, Newburyport&lt;/em&gt; without
either giving up a hundred pages in or starting to ask yourself
questions like &lt;em&gt;What is this book trying to do?&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;What’s
the point of the unusual structure of this thing?&lt;/em&gt; and, like,
&lt;em&gt;What even is a novel, anyway, man?&lt;/em&gt; And though I opened this
post with &lt;em&gt;Infinite Jest&lt;/em&gt; because I think &lt;em&gt;Ducks,
Newburyport&lt;/em&gt;’s heft necessarily invites comparison to other hefty,
maximalist novels, I hesitate to call &lt;em&gt;Ducks&lt;/em&gt; maximalist just
because it is actually very stylistically homogenous. It’s just big. But
there’s a subversiveness and an audacity in spending &lt;em&gt;so much
time&lt;/em&gt; in the thoughts of this one everywoman as she struggles with
the quotidian stresses of raising children and baking tarts and
psychologically coping with being an American woman in the late
twenty-teens. It suggests that with enough attention, any person can be
an epic hero whose struggles warrant a weighty doorstopper of a tome.
But, aside from &lt;em&gt;Ducks&lt;/em&gt;, we don’t often get a chance to read such
a book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not good at spotting and analyzing literary devices, so if
&lt;em&gt;Ducks, Newburyport&lt;/em&gt; employs any subtle ones, I didn’t pick up on
them. But the naturally cyclic, obsessive thought patterns of the
anxious person (to which I am no stranger) introduce a natural
continuity and some thematic through-lines to a story that might
otherwise be unreadably shapeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: &lt;em&gt;Ducks, Newburyport&lt;/em&gt; is engaging despite its narrative not
really having an “arc”. Its flouting of conventions makes it what it is,
and the mountain lion sections, effective as they are as a foil for the
primary narrative, do feel like a bit of a concession to the artifice
that’s the water most novels swim in.&lt;span
class=&#34;sidenote-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span
class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ducks, Newburyport&lt;/em&gt; is all artifice too, of
course. It purports to be the inner monologue of a person who’s not the
author; how could it not be? But one of its greatest achievements is
that it doesn’t &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like it is.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; All this may be why the conclusion of the novel was kind
of a weird letdown, despite pulling together a lot of threads in an
actually very narratively satisfying way. My initial reaction was: Hell
yeah! The payoff, at last! But then later, the fact that there
&lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a payoff started to feel incongruous with the rest of the
book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When evaluating how “believable” a work of fiction is, I tend to
stick to a sort of analogue of the &lt;a
href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle&#34;&gt;anthropic
principle&lt;/a&gt;. Sure, the events in a story may be improbable. But for
many stories, that very improbability is why the story is remarkable,
and thus, why it’s being told in the first place. Until its last hundred
pages, though, &lt;em&gt;Ducks, Newburyport&lt;/em&gt; makes something truly
&lt;em&gt;novel&lt;/em&gt;, no pun intended, out of events that don’t feel
meticulously and purposefully constructed and arranged. For me, the
tidiness of the ending counterproductively reined in the glorious, messy
sprawl of what came before it. In an ordinary novel, it would have been
an unambiguous triumph. The problem is that &lt;em&gt;Ducks, Newburyport&lt;/em&gt;
is not an ordinary novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;em&gt;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&lt;/em&gt; was basically fine. I find that I have a notion of it in my head as a book that enjoyed a period of hipness in America, maybe because of the efficient set-em-up-and-knock-em-down summary in Maciej Cegłowski’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://idlewords.com/2005/11/dating_without_kundera.htm&#34;&gt;Dating Without Kundera&lt;/a&gt;. It has some of the trappings that I could see a hip book having — the frank (but never actually sexy) depictions of sex, the pseudo-profound philosophical musings of an omniscient narrator, the mix of political struggle and tawdry personal drama — and while each of these components may have been more or less compelling in their own way, they never gelled into anything greater than the sum of their parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know. Sometimes I’m lukewarm on a book but it still gives me things to think about. This one was just fine, and I have no desire to think about it any more. The narrator’s bloviations were generally laughable. The depiction of life under an oppressive Communist regime was convincingly tense, though it never really seemed to have any stakes. The gender politics were embarrassing: the women have some agency but seem constantly driven by their neuroses, whereas the men’s drives are treated as implacable forces of nature. I don’t think it passed the Bechdel test. So rather than face The Unbearable Prospect of Writing Another Word About This Book,&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Note: This is the eighth in a series of posts about books I read for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spl.org/programs-and-services/authors-and-books/2022-book-bingo&#34;&gt;Seattle Public Library’s 2022 Book Bingo&lt;/a&gt;. It fills the &lt;em&gt;A SAL speaker (past or upcoming)&lt;/em&gt; square on the bingo card, according to a display case at my local library. SAL stands for Seattle Arts and Lectures and I unfortunately don’t pay too much attention to it. I’m posting this one before the seventh book I read because I own that one, but &lt;em&gt;Interior Chinatown&lt;/em&gt; has to go back to the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m having a hard time figuring out how I feel about &lt;em&gt;Interior Chinatown&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a screenplay, but also a novel. It’s a moving, contemplative story about the experience of Asian immigrants in America, but also a cartoonishly broad parody of a cop show. I don’t know how well it worked because I don’t totally know what it was supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, its main character Willis Wu doesn’t know what he’s supposed to be either. For much of the book, his dream is to be “Kung Fu Guy,” the highest position available under the sort of glass ceiling that caps the aspirations of &lt;em&gt;Interior Chinatown&lt;/em&gt;’s Chinese men. But the book blurs the boundaries so much between Willis’s real life, his role in the unsubtly-named cop show “Black and White” (featuring, natch, a black man and a white woman as partners investigating a murder in Chinatown), and his position as an actor forever trying to inch his way into bigger parts, that they diffuse into a kind of haze that just obscured things for me. The constant shifts in framing left me feeling destabilized and uncertain what, if anything, I was meant to regard as “real” or even to take seriously, and the archness of the satire didn’t help matters. There was, I think, an actual plot, as well, but it often felt beside the point: much of it happens inside the cop show whose relationship to reality is either suspect or just clouded by a layer of metaphor too thick for me to see through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I think there’s a case to be made that all this was intentional. The kernels of solid themes that I was able to see through the smoke and mirrors support this: Willis has absorbed enough of America’s copious stereotypes of Asians, and in particular Chinese men, that his vision of himself is constrained by those stereotypes. He’s barely able to see himself as other than a supporting character in his own life, and so the fuzziness between role and reality is a reflection of the inside of Willis’s head. It’s a disorienting and, wry sixth-wall-breaking&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-0&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-0&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;I use this to mean the actual author Charles Yu’s metacommentary on the events of the novel through poking fun at racist tropes in his absurd cop show. The novel seems to do so much fourth-wall breaking of its own, in its weirdly overlapping narratives, that I’m adding a couple walls when describing the effect of Yu’s authorial voice just to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; jokes about racism aside, unpleasant place to be. So while I don’t think it worked super well for me personally, I don’t think I can say the novel was ineffective at what it &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; to be doing. Its title, of course, is another clue: &lt;em&gt;Interior Chinatown&lt;/em&gt; as in &lt;code&gt;Int. Chinatown&lt;/code&gt;, sure, a stage direction in a screenplay, but also Willis’s personal Chinatown that he holds in his head and that contains and limits him in turn. Paradoxical, sure. Par for the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m focusing a lot on the artifice of this book when it actually has a fair amount of fairly normal narrative as well, mostly in telling the stories of some of its central characters’ family histories immigrating to (and struggling in) America. But these sections work in a more straightforwardly moving way. So, too, does the last third or so of the book, which pushes Willis toward seeing himself as a man with ambitions not dictated by the roles that racist America wants to cast him in. So I think this book will sink or swim depending how comfortable the reader is with the ambiguity of its central, distinguishing conceit. As I’ve said, it didn’t totally work for me. But I felt like I got where it was coming from.&lt;/p&gt;

            <summary type="html">Note: This is the sixth in a series of posts about books I read for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spl.org/programs-and-services/authors-and-books/2022-book-bingo&#34;&gt;Seattle Public Library’s 2022 Book Bingo&lt;/a&gt;.

I’m posting this one before the fifth book I read because I own that one, but &lt;em&gt;In the Dream House&lt;/em&gt; has to go back to the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to all the other books so far, I read &lt;em&gt;In the Dream House&lt;/em&gt; very fast, in the same way that if your house was on fire, you would run out very fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carmen Maria Machado’s first book, &lt;em&gt;Her Body and Other Parties&lt;/em&gt;, made a splash upon its release. It was a collection of visceral, sensual short stories that bordered on the upsetting, and I have a distinct memory of reading it while waiting for a bus in downtown Seattle. “&lt;a href=&#34;https://granta.com/The-Husband-Stitch/&#34;&gt;The Husband Stitch&lt;/a&gt;,” which may be its hallmark story&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-0&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-0&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;Or just its most-freely-available-on-the-internet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, shares many concerns with &lt;em&gt;In the Dream House&lt;/em&gt;: intense, consuming love shot through with danger; women’s bodily autonomy; stories viewed and refracted ominously through other stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no spoiler to say that &lt;em&gt;In the Dream House&lt;/em&gt; is about an abusive relationship. Even if you don’t read the book jacket, or anything about the book, Machado reveals as much in the prologue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Husband Stitch” was notable, in small part, for how it both subverted traditional fairy tales and didn’t. In &lt;em&gt;Dream House&lt;/em&gt;, Machado employs a similar tension between her prologue and the preceding “Overture,” which reads, in its entirety:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never read prologues. I find them tedious. If what the author has to say is so important, why relegate it to the paratext? What are they trying to hide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prologue that follows, then, certainly starts out like a text that has something to hide, like it’s trying to be tedious to obscure something and not quite succeeding. But after seven scholarly, allusive paragraphs that cite Derrida and Borges and Greek etymology and generally feel like the intro to a doctoral dissertation, Machado finally lays it out there plainly, a woman with something to say and nothing to hide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enter into the archive that domestic abuse between partners who share a gender identity is both possible and not uncommon, and that it can look something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This” is, narratively, a fractured but generally linear series of some 150 or so vignettes ranging from a few pages to a single paragraph, each titled in the following style: “&lt;em&gt;Dream House&lt;/em&gt; as Lesbian Cult Classic.” “&lt;em&gt;Dream House&lt;/em&gt; as Chekhov’s Gun.” “&lt;em&gt;Dream House&lt;/em&gt; as a Lesson in the Subjunctive.” It’s stylistically dazzling and, because it doesn’t linger on any one moment for too long, as easy to read as it must have been hard to write. But still, the overall effect is that of a horror story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all of &lt;em&gt;In the Dream House&lt;/em&gt; is in second person, so that it’s &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, reader, in the dream house in an increasingly untenable situation. If you are inclined to wonder why someone in this situation would stay, it seems to point the finger back at you: &lt;em&gt;why are you still reading, then?&lt;/em&gt; Because you want to see it through, one way or another. Because despite how harrowing it is, it’s compelling and even captivating. Because you want to see how bad it can get, though not one single drop of blood is shed. Spoiler that is not a spoiler: it can get pretty fucking bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the Dream House&lt;/em&gt; is a challenging book: easy to read but very hard to linger on. Still, despite that I usually prefer my entertainment less fraught, I thought it was fantastic. The thing is that while it’s hard material to read about, it’s not unrelenting. Machado often pulls back from the nightmare that makes up the bulk of the narrative to take hindsight-informed, more expansive looks at her situation, to understand and contextualize it. The framing device is brilliant, and Machado does some very clever, inventive things with it. And throughout, the writing is just outstanding: it pulls you into the all-too-common tense and oppressive moments, but the more dispassionate chapters are sharp and insightful and there are even some very darkly funny bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there it is: you know what you’re getting into if you read &lt;em&gt;In the Dream House&lt;/em&gt;, but I really think you should. Does it help if I tell you it has an almost implausibly happy ending?&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Note: This is the fourth in a series of posts about books I read for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spl.org/programs-and-services/authors-and-books/2022-book-bingo&#34;&gt;Seattle Public Library’s 2022 Book Bingo&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chef’s Kiss&lt;/em&gt; is a cute graphic novel about a college graduate, Ben, who ends up working as a chef in a restaurant after trying and failing to find a writing job. He develops a powerful crush on Liam, one of the restaurant’s other chefs, and ultimately has to make a tough decision about what he really wants in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought &lt;em&gt;Chef’s Kiss&lt;/em&gt; was fine. The plot felt like I’d seen it, or all its various components, before, so it sinks or swims on the strength of its execution, which I found to be a mixed bag. Ben is a bit naïve and emotionally immature, which is fine and wholly to be expected since he’s fresh out of college, but stories whose main characters make a lot of unforced errors need something to make the wincing&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-0&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-0&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;Some might refer to this as “cringe,” but that term has been ruined by the Internet, so that it now often refers to expressions of unselfconscious joy or enthusiasm. I am referring here to the wince of sympathy (and, possibly, recognition) that comes with seeing someone make a decision you know is bad.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; go down easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/2022/07/30/Giant_Days&#34;&gt;Giant Days&lt;/a&gt; had plenty of college students making questionable choices too, but for me, it got away with it by moving on quickly and making good jokes. &lt;em&gt;Chef’s Kiss&lt;/em&gt;’s humor too often fell flat for me: notably, a sequence where Ben’s roommate gets drunk and speaks in Shakespeare quotes for several pages just didn’t land at all. The humor, and the art, feel very manga-esque, and the somewhat over-the-top nature of it all clashed with the very down-to-earth struggle of trying to find a job after college. But &lt;em&gt;Giant Days&lt;/em&gt; got away with some cartoonishness in a similar setting, so it probably just comes down to my liking the writing there more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book picks up in its second half, when it settles into Ben’s attempts to impress the restaurant’s gruff head chef (or more precisely, the chef’s pet pig, the final arbiter of which dishes make the menu). In one of the most manga-y elements of the book, the head chef gives Ben three challenges that he has to pass in order to get the job. Ben’s proficiency at cooking is never really in question; more interesting is how his obsession with passing the challenges causes conflicts with his best friend and with his intention to get a job writing. The resolutions won’t come as any particular surprise, but Ben’s character growth is convincing and the character beats work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chef’s Kiss&lt;/em&gt; is good enough to justify the 30 or 40 minutes it will take you to read it. The art is quite good and the writing gets the job done, and it has some charming moments along the way. Some of the execution didn’t work for me, but it wasn’t enough to keep me from finishing and ultimately enjoying it. I can see someone with a different sense of humor really loving it.&lt;/p&gt;

I read all 14 volumes of this serial comic on my back porch, one volume per day, to fill the &lt;em&gt;Read outside&lt;/em&gt; square on the bingo card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my stupidest skills is giving gifts to my partner that are, secretly or not-so-, also gifts to myself. &lt;em&gt;Giant Days&lt;/em&gt; was such a gift, but in fairness, she did specifically ask for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Giant Days&lt;/em&gt; is a comic written by John Allison, the relatively well-known author of &lt;em&gt;Bobbins&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Scary-Go-Round&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bad Machinery&lt;/em&gt; from back in the heyday of early-2000s serial web comics. Allison illustrated those comics himself, and while I had no complaints about his art when I was reading them, Lissa Treiman and &lt;a href=&#34;http://maxsarin.com/&#34;&gt;Max Sarin&lt;/a&gt;’s work on &lt;em&gt;Giant Days&lt;/em&gt; really kick it up to another level of expressiveness and, honestly, comedy. John Allison is one of the best phrase-turners in webcomics&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-0&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-0&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;Second, in my estimation, only to the incomparable &lt;a href=&#34;http://achewood.com/&#34;&gt;Achewood&lt;/a&gt;, about which &lt;a href=&#34;https://keithpille.com/digging-into-achewood/&#34;&gt;much&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://catandgirl.com/steak-house/&#34;&gt;digital ink&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/cartoon-lounge/an-interview-with-the-achewood-artist-chris-onstad&#34;&gt;has been&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://deadshirt.net/2014/01/29/damn-this-is-a-thing-isnt-it-the-language-of-achewood/&#34;&gt;justifiably spilled&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — one need only look at the blurbs for his &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.patreon.com/scarygoround&#34;&gt;patreon tiers&lt;/a&gt; to see this — but the illustrations frequently push the jokes into literal, actual laugh-out-loud territory. Treiman’s work on the first six issues is very good. Sarin’s on the remainder is &lt;em&gt;wonderful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;Julia Madrigal draws a couple issues in the middle of the series. They are all right, and I think I would like Madrigal’s art just fine if she were the main illustrator, but by this point Sarin has made the characters so thoroughly their own that the change is a bit jarring.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Giant Days&lt;/em&gt; follows three British girls through their three years of college, or “uni” or whatever they call it in Britain. Esther de Groot, who got by far the most air time in Allison’s previous work under the name “Dark Esther,” is a snarky, bubbly Goth with a propensity for chaotic drama and a horny streak. Susan Ptolemy is the trio’s realist, a “powerful and complicated woman” who hides her love for her friends under a tough exterior. Daisy Wooten is a sincere and sweet but rather naïve homeschool kid who harbors secret skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-2&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;&gt;&amp;#8853;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-2&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;marginnote&#34;&gt; The party’s over, but the trio aren’t finished.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/assets/images/posts/Giant_Days/skinny_dipping.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Esther de Groot, joyous and slightly manic: “Let’s go skinny dipping!” Susan Ptolemy, appalled but intrigued: “Agh! What! No! Okay!” Daisy Wooten, appalled and recoiling: “I am not going skinny dipping! My body is a secret!”&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a lot to say about &lt;em&gt;Giant Days&lt;/em&gt; except that it’s very, very, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good. The plot is fine and engaging enough, but it’s really just an excuse to bounce the characters off each other in interesting ways. The dialogue is top-notch, as is the art. That each issue is mostly a self-contained story means it’s easy to pick up and put down again ten to fifteen minutes later in a better mood. Rather than extol its virtues, I’m just going to drop some lovingly photographed favorite panels and call this blog post done. You should read &lt;em&gt;Giant Days&lt;/em&gt; if you can get your hands on it.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Note: This is the second in a series of posts about books I read for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spl.org/programs-and-services/authors-and-books/2022-book-bingo&#34;&gt;Seattle Public Library’s 2022 Book Bingo&lt;/a&gt;. This book could fill any of the following squares on the bingo card: &lt;em&gt;Debut author&lt;/em&gt; (if it counts for it to be the author’s debut &lt;em&gt;novel&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;em&gt;Blue cover&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Sci-fi or fantasy by a BIPOC author&lt;/em&gt; (if magical realism counts)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up Ta-Nehisi Coates’s first novel, &lt;em&gt;The Water Dancer&lt;/em&gt;, on a whim when I saw it at the library. I’d read and been moved by many of Coates’s essays but wasn’t even aware he had a novel, so it was a good opportunity, like with &lt;em&gt;The Memory Librarian&lt;/em&gt;, to go into a book having a vague idea of what to expect but being prepared to have it thwarted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, when I picked it up I suspected that &lt;em&gt;The Water Dancer&lt;/em&gt; would be about slavery, which has been — &lt;em&gt;justifiably, I hasten to add!&lt;/em&gt; — a preoccupation of Coates’s in his other writing for some time. Both the slavery that everyone knows about and the long-tail “second slavery” of post-emancipation depredations feature prominently in what may be his most famous essay, “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/&#34;&gt;The Case for Reparations&lt;/a&gt;.” And my suspicions were borne out almost immediately, but while &lt;em&gt;The Water Dancer&lt;/em&gt; is often tough going as you might expect, it’s far less dour than I feared. Coates himself describes it as a story set against the backdrop of slavery, rather than a slavery narrative &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of this is just that the main character Hiram is the acknowledged son of a white man, and not just any white man, but the master of the house of Lockless in which he serves. He’s enslaved (or, as the book somewhat euphemistically has it, Tasked) nonetheless, but with access to some privileges and aspirations on account of his birth and his immaculate memory which has him occasionally called upon to perform parlor tricks for the amusement of houseguests. But the story never lets us forget how constrained and contingent these privileges are. For all Hiram’s photographic memory, he cannot remember anything about his own mother. And he’s expected to attend to his feckless brother Maynard and even, somehow — despite having no authority over him — rein him in. That Maynard might grow into a responsible master of Lockless, which at the start of the novel is beginning a slow decline, and restore it to its former glory is just one of numerous protective delusions that Hiram observes the book’s white characters clinging to. Hiram harbors dreams of being the next steward of Lockless and (correctly) recognizes himself as a better candidate for the role than Maynard. And on some level the white people of Lockless must see this as well, but they’re unable to acknowledge it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiram is perceptive in some ways and totally blinkered in others for which he’s quick to self-remonstrate. (Perhaps his supernatural memory means he remembers his mistakes and misconceptions even more sharply than the average person.) His almost totally dispassionate narration risks leaving him feeling like a bit of a cipher, personality-wise — the “mask” that he alludes to having up when dealing with white folks never really seems to come down — but the events he’s recounting speak for themselves enough that I don’t think the story would be helped by his being more demonstrative. And then there’s the mysterious ability known as “conduction,” essentially a kind of teleportation, that he possesses but is unable to truly control. In a way, the novel centers around it, but aside from making him a person of interest to various significant parties, it exerts more of a gravitational than a direct pull on the direction of the plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was worried &lt;em&gt;The Water Dancer&lt;/em&gt; would feel like homework, but it did not. Coates’s writing is as beautiful and economical as ever, and the plot is gripping and brisk with the forgivable exception of a middle section that dragged on a bit longer and more repetitively than was necessary. I want to avoid spoiling anything, as there were a couple of plot points that I found pleasantly surprising, but suffice to say that I also thought the ending did also tie off several loose threads in a satisfying and graceful way. All in all, Coates’s first novel lived up to the high expectations he set with the rest of his body of work. Recommended!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/containers/music/music2010&#34;&gt;I’ve been a fan of Janelle Monáe’s music&lt;/a&gt; since her 2010 debut LP &lt;em&gt;The ArchAndroid&lt;/em&gt;, and being quite familiar with her whole discography did not equip me with any intuitions about what to expect from Monáe’s short story collection and first book. &lt;em&gt;The ArchAndroid&lt;/em&gt;, together with the &lt;em&gt;Metropolis: The Chase Suite&lt;/em&gt; EP that preceded it and &lt;em&gt;The Electric Lady&lt;/em&gt; which followed, sort of kind of tells some kind of story. Or at least their songs are all kind of set in the same science fictional city, with a plotline of sorts that’s pervasive in the &lt;em&gt;Metropolis&lt;/em&gt; EP but gradually disintegrates into a loose theme in the genre-hopping second half of &lt;em&gt;ArchAndroid&lt;/em&gt; and is dropped almost entirely in &lt;em&gt;Electric Lady&lt;/em&gt;. And Monáe’s most recent album &lt;em&gt;Dirty Computer&lt;/em&gt;, on which this book is actually based, leaves Metropolis entirely and has no claim to a linear plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this is just as well, as music that tries to hew too close to a coherent plotline often sacrifices what makes a good album to do so. But it means that Monáe’s music doesn’t give a good sense of what to expect from her as a fiction writer. Too, each of &lt;em&gt;The Memory Librarian&lt;/em&gt;’s five stories was written with a different collaborator. So all this is to reiterate that I went into this book fully expecting it to thwart any of my preconceived notions about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Memory Librarian&lt;/em&gt; does not read like a book from a musician dilettante written as a vanity project, as I feared it might. Its references to Monáe’s music are subtle and tasteful. The title, “Pynk,” of a song about feminine solidarity is repurposed as an all-woman creative refuge, and one that’s defiantly, unambiguously trans-inclusive, as though Monáe wanted to shake off any lingering accusations of exclusion in the song itself. References to misfits and outcasts as “dirty computers,” used mainly as a sort of reclaimed slur, are very in keeping with her LP of the same name. An underground radio DJ from &lt;em&gt;The Electric Lady&lt;/em&gt; makes a cameo. These are nice little touches for fans, but they don’t dominate the experience of reading the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stories don’t have much of a throughline, besides the oppressive surveillance regime New Dawn that serves as the direct or indirect antagonist of almost every main character. I think they would have benefited from a few more connections to flesh out the world a bit more and make it feel a bit more cohesive and fully realized. As it is, though, it’s easier for me to think about them in isolation, and I’m going to indulge myself and rank them. I will try to avoid any significant spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type=&#34;1&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Timebox.” Written with Eve L. Ewing. Perhaps not coincidentally, also the shortest story. These things coincide not because I wanted any of these stories to be over sooner, but because this one is more compact and economical: it sets up a situation relatively quickly, maintains a sense of tension and vague dread for its entire length, and ends with an effective gut punch. It’s the least dependent on its setting — it could easily be set in present-day America — and its antagonist is believably well-meaning but despicable nonetheless. Most effective, though, is that tension. The main character is at the end of her rope and you really feel her lack of support, and feel for her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Save Changes.” Written with Yohanca Delgado. A real classic short-story-ass short story with the classic third-act reversal, and characters rendered well enough to make it count, to make the stakes feel high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Nevermind.” Written with Danny Lore. Novella-sized. The most action-packed sci-fi thing here. A real post-apocalyptic hardscrabble kind of setting, with shades of &lt;em&gt;Parable of the Sower&lt;/em&gt;, but with more joy mixed in. I’m ambivalent because the ending is a bit heavy-handed, but Pynk Hotel is a well-realized refuge and its inhabitants’ struggle to be better than their oppressors in hard situations is a convincing one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The Memory Librarian.” Written with Alaya Dawn Johnson. A decent story that suffers from — if you’ll allow me a music analogy — a strange sequencing choice. Having the first story set in the heart of New Dawn, before we really get a chance to see New Dawn’s effect on those outside it, kind of mutes its impact. It’s disorienting in a way that didn’t work for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Timebox Altar(ed).” Written with Sheree Renée Thomas. The most heavy-handed of the five, with too high a showing-to-telling ratio. Its hopeful visions are stirring but don’t feel completely earned. This is the story that I think would have benefitted most from having more threads running through the whole book: the dreams these characters are having are the kind that need solidarity, a mass movement, to achieve. But the characters we see in this book all occupy their own islands, large or small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, though, &lt;em&gt;The Memory Librarian&lt;/em&gt; is as good a read as I hoped it would be (which is to say: quite good, but less than amazing). It’s consistent with the world that Janelle Monáe has set up in her music, where marginalized people manage to thrive even in a world that tries to squash or erase them, but it stands satisfyingly apart from that music as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;section id=&#34;background-and-why-this-recipe&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background and Why This Recipe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t drink alcohol, for the simple reason that I don’t like it and can’t “taste through it” to discern whatever unique qualities alcoholic drinks have. But I am intrigued by the complexity that other people are able to taste in cocktails and wines and such, so now that mocktails seem to be having a moment, I’ve acquired &lt;em&gt;Zero&lt;/em&gt; in hopes that I can get some of that drinking experience without alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zero&lt;/em&gt; is divided into five sections: the “back bar” of real-world spirit approximations, “classic cocktails” which combine the back bar components to simulate well-known cocktails, “wines” which do the same but for wines and without depending on the back bar, “modern cocktails” which take non-alcoholic ingredients in some interesting new directions, and “etcetera” which is a real grab bag including a milkshake and a “breakfast stout.” This post is about the “bitter amaro” on page 36, in the “back bar” section. It’s apparently based on an Italian digestif named Cynar (CHEE-nar), but that didn’t mean anything to me when I decided I wanted to make it. Like most of the concoctions I’ve made so far from &lt;em&gt;Zero&lt;/em&gt;, I chose bitter amaro based on its ingredient list: many of the recipes that are most intriguing are ones that have ingredients that I have some idea where to find but would never expect to use in a drink. For bitter amaro this was the half-kilogram of “whole artichokes, roughly chopped” that accounts for about half of the non-water volume of the recipe.&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;In doing some research for this post, I discovered that Cynar is also artichoke-based, which was a little disappointing. I was hoping the Alinea folks had invented a novel technique for simulating flavors available in alcoholic drinks by other means.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As interesting as an artichoke-based drink was, the process was even more so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combine the water and artichokes in a blender… allow to sit uncovered for 2 hours… the mixture will aggressively oxidize, turning nearly black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d previously managed to find the three most esoteric of the required ingredients (the bittering agents gentian root, cinchona bark and angelica root) at a local specialty grocery store, so when I noticed artichokes on sale on a regular shopping trip, it was off to the races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;process-and-adaptations&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Process and Adaptations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recipe for bitter amaro calls for blending the water and artichokes in a blender, but I don’t have a full-size blender; just an immersion blender and a food processor. I opted to use the food processor for this, since the intent seemed just to be to pulverize it enough to get a lot of surface area and accelerate the oxidization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results turned out fine, I think; more on that below. But the process was unpleasant. I had to do it in three or four batches because the water kept sloshing out of the non-airtight seal between the food processor’s bowl and lid. And though it didn’t make it into the final product, the blended mixture had a lot of foam that didn’t recede for the entirety of the 2-hour oxidization period. I don’t know if this would have happened with a blender, but it was really only a problem when I tried to take pictures to show the color of the liquid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;marginnote&#34;&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/assets/images/posts/Bitter_Amaro/mixture@2x.jpeg&#34; rel=&#34;bytebox&#34;&gt; &lt;img
alt=&#34;A wide frying pan filled with liquid, with tan foam covering most of the top. A spatula is pushing aside some of the foam to show that the liquid is a dark brown with flecks of pale green vegetable matter in it. Serious witches&#39; brew vibes.&#34;
src=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/assets/images/posts/Bitter_Amaro/mixture_thumb.jpeg&#34;
&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other adaptation was that the recipe called for 200g of Coca-Cola. I do not keep Coke around in general but happened to have some fancy cola syrup from the same specialty grocery store I got my bittering agents from, so I used that instead. At the recommended dilution it was noticeably less sweet than Coke so I added a bit of agave nectar. For a recipe that measures ingredients by the gram, this was pretty imprecise, but I’m not a well-known molecular gastronomy establishment so precision and consistency are not terribly important to me if I can get the broad strokes right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recipe has you melt some sugar in a pan and then add the (strained) artichoke liquid to it, a bit at a time so as to incorporate it gradually. I don’t think I really have the hang of this in a couple ways: first, you’re not supposed to let the sugar start smoking, but unless you melt sugar all the time it’s hard to know when this will happen until it does. So I may have burnt the sugar a bit more than you’re supposed to, and I think the product may have been a bit more bitter than intended as a result. Also, adding the liquid did not go very smoothly for me. It’s always a bit scary adding liquid to a pan of 350-degree-plus sugar napalm, but at no point did it spatter or do anything that seemed like it might burn me. On the culinary rather than the safety side, though, I haven’t gotten the hang of incorporating the liquid smoothly without ending up with liquid on top of a layer of nearly solid and difficult-to-deal-with caramel. So when I added the rest of the ingredients for the simmering/steeping step of the process, I had to scrape and break up the sugar to get it to dissolve. I think the flavor of the final result probably wasn’t affected much if at all by this, but it definitely felt inelegant and frustrating to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the difficulties, I ended up with something complex, drinkable and interesting. As you’d expect both from its name and from the phrase “aggressively oxidize,” bitter amaro is quite bitter. But it’s not unpalatably so, and it’s balanced with a host of other interesting flavors. The artichoke flavor is not what you’d expect if you’re used to marinated artichokes, where you’re eating only the heart heavily seasoned with vinegar and other stuff. Instead, it has a weird, sort of spicy (in the “spice” sence, not the “heat” sense), a bit reminiscent of fennel with the anise flavor cooked out maybe. It’s hard to describe (which I suspect will be a recurring difficulty if I continue this series) but unique and surprisingly good as a beverage component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy drinking this straight a lot more than I expected. A shot glass is enough — maybe more than enough — and it’s viscous enough from the caramelized sugar that tiny sips are the only sensible way to consume it. The experience of drinking it this way is one of almost-but-not-quite-overpowering sweetness that smoothly recedes to let the bitterness come through. And come through it does, and it lingers a bit longer than I’d probably prefer, though this is a problem easily remedied with a drink of water to wash it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zero&lt;/em&gt; has only one other recipe that uses bitter amaro, and it’s “Amaro and Coke” which is exactly what you’d expect. I used my fancy cola syrup for this too, with seltzer water to make it “Coke-like,” and it’s a nice way to make soda feel more grown-up, though it’s still quite sweet. I think I have also tried bitter amaro straight with seltzer, and didn’t care for it as much: it’s so assertive that watering it down seems sort of contrary to its whole deal. All in all, pretty hard to make, but worth it. Your mileage may vary though: my partner reacts to it the same way I do when I try her wine, with a grimace and a shudder.&lt;/p&gt;

Our simple joys are made a bitter joke

Still, simple joy is all there ever was.
And no encroaching eschaton can wreck

Let’s gather hands on tools before the fuzz

Let’s wire up a light against the fall.

        Fall; Or, A Neal Stephenson Fan In Hell
    
    
    Warning: this post will contain lots of spoilers about Neal Stephenson’s novel Fall; Or, Dodge In Hell.
I think it started around two thirds of the way through Fall, when Egdod suggested none too subtly to his children that they call themselves Adam and Eve. Egdod, the titular Dodge — having died and been brain-scanned and booted up as something like a God in a digital afterlife known on Earth as “Bitworld” — is in the guise of a worm after having been cast out of the Land he built out of raw computing power by Elmo Shepherd. Elmo, or just El, who we’re led to believe by his attempts to wrest control over the resources powering the Land is the antagonist of Fall, wants something more from the Land than the MMO-style playground that Dodge has shaped it into. He’s raising the entities who will henceforth call themselves Adam and Eve in an Eden-style garden, in the hope that having been birthed in the Land will enable them (unlike all the other “souls” who died on Earth and were rebooted in the cloud) to be the vanguard of something new and not so beholden to humanity’s Earthly constraints. Instead, presumably through Egdod’s apocalypticThe Greek word “apocalypse” means “a disclosure of great knowledge,” and that’s the sense in which I use it here.

 influence, Adam and Eve learn of the time before El came to power and El casts them out of the Garden for it. And lo, humanity’s wondrous computational afterlife is reduced to Bible cosplay. I thought: am I supposed to be cheering for Dodge here?
Well, yes; because El turns out to be a fascist. So we root for Dodge because while he lacks imagination and much of a personality and his Land is basically a Middle Ages historical reenactment LARP, at least it’s not a police state. But Stephenson never really convincingly makes the case that this is an afterlife to be hoped for, or even an improvement on none at all. Insofar as we have access to the thoughts of his characters, I think they might agree, if they stopped to consider it. Corvallis Kawasaki, Fall’s first POV character after Dodge’s “meatspace” death, engages in some historical reenactment of his own — as a Roman legionnaire — as a youngish man early in the novel. Five hundred pages and maybe forty or fifty real-world years later, he thinks to himself, “Being a Roman soldier had been fun for a while too, but past a certain age you couldn’t dig those ditches anymore.” Of course, he shortly dies and is uploaded to Bitworld, and guess what, motherfucker! It’s ditch-digging time!Granted, in Bitworld Corvallis is a large raven, thanks to some mind- and body-hacking he engages in pre-mortem. Still, despite his best efforts, he is compelled to dig his share of ditches, just not necessarily literal ones.


Perhaps Stephenson’s afterlife isn’t a compelling one because he never follows through on its philosophical underpinnings. There are tendrils of a more interesting and adventurous book poking through Fall at intervals, but Stephenson never really develops them in a satisfying way. My favorite notion, which recurs several times in different guises and concludes with no payoff whatsoever, is that of intersubjectivity and shared consensus. It shows up in the book’s real-world hoax-incineration of the town of Moab, AZ and subsequent depiction of “Ameristan,” a near future extrapolation of current red-state America whose shared consensus has become entirely disconnected from objective reality. It appears again when Egdod finds his powers to shape reality in the Land limited in the presence of other souls whose perception of that reality act as a kind of friction against changes to it. And in the last meatspace scene before the fantasy novella that comprises Fall’s last two hundred pages, Corvallis muses (omissions are of some plotty details but don’t change the quote’s flavor):

What does it mean for a thing to be convincing? Qualia are only part of it… it turns out that we are wired for intersubjectivity. Our perception of reality is as much social as it is personal… Why do prisoners in solitary confinement go nuts? Because they don’t have others to confirm their perceptions… others have to see it, and react. Ratifying the qualia, cross-linking the history into a social matrix.

That that idea was so vividly and, relatively successfully, evoked in the book’s Ameristan section makes it all the more frustrating that the book’s final section drops it entirely. What is the Land if not a sort of shared hallucination? And yet the fantasy romp of Fall’s final section is played completely straight, with precious little connecting it to the sometimes heady matters of the last 600 pages, and precious little about it allowing for a vision of reality other than the one created by Egdod on a whim.
Early in the existence of the Land, there is actually a brief glimpse at an alternative: a Tower that an enterprising group of souls build out of their own “essence” commingled into an orgy of computational power to rival Egdod’s own and also probably a literal orgy. Now that’s what I call ratifying the qualia! A hedonistic vision of the afterlife, perhaps, but presumably a compelling one to those who entered into it voluntarily. And, unfortunately, an analogue to the Tower of Babel. So Egdod blows it up with a lightning bolt.
Immediately after Corvallis’s quote about intersubjectivity above, he and Dodge’s niece Zula ponder whether Dodge’s having booted up in a blank Bitspace, completely devoid of qualia, might have been a kind of hell. Certainly it was a kind of solitary confinement. And yet, despite that Dodge should thus have “[gone] nuts,” and despite that El’s encroaching mental illness is repeatedly darkly hinted at as instigating or at least exacerbating his megalomania, the world Egdod creates is a coherent and even shockingly quotidian one, and it seems we’re intended to be sympathetic to his own totalitarian response to potential challenges to his dominance. It’s as if the following treatment of Dodge, criticized by Abigail Nussbaum in her review of Fall’s sort-of prequel Reamde, has metastasized to encompass the creation of an entire world:

It is “a belief that had been inculcated in him from the get-go,” we are told, “that there was an objective reality, which all people worth talking to could observe and understand, and that there was no point in arguing about anything that could be so observed and so understood.” But for Richard, that objective reality seems to mean whatever he thinks about the world…

Fall is the literal apotheosis of that treatment, and we in turn are treated to a book where whatever Dodge thinks about the world becomes objective reality. This damages the Bitworld section of Fall both coming and going. The several chapters devoted wholly to Egdod’s construction of the Land are some of the most boring prose Stephenson has ever put to paper, written in a florid sort of pseudo-Biblical style that completely flattens the little personality Dodge displayed in the two chapters preceding his meatspace death. And the vaguely Tolkeinesque quest at the end is diminished not only by its dependence on a whole new group of hitherto unknown and generally unmemorable characters but also by its stakes: why are we invested in a quest whose goal is to restore to prominence a God who made of Heaven an EverQuest?
So: perhaps least of Fall’s many sins is that large swathes of it are boring, especially after the early appearance of Enoch Root and something called the Waterhouse Foundation seem to indicate a return to the freewheeling and slightly manic energy of Cryptonomicon. For all its faults, even at its most digressive (and it got pretty fucking digressive), Cryptonomicon was always fun or at least stylistically lively enough to carry you along on sheer verve.
Abigail Nussbaum, quoted just above, seems to have tapped out of reviewing Stephenson after she panned Reamde, which is probably good for her but a shame for me as I expect she’d have had some incisive things to say about Fall’s Anglocentrism. But maybe there’s not much to say about it except that it’s everything Nussbaum already criticized in her Reamde review, writ even larger. I checked the internet for others who cottoned on to this. One of the few who did so was Robert McGrath, whose critical review covers quite well the tremendous blinders Stephenson seems to be wearing here.
So in the end, what are we left with as a vision of the future in Fall? The operation that created Bitworld grows and grows until it’s a global operation collecting protection money from everyone who wants a shot at Dodge’s creatively impoverished afterlife, built on Biblical and Greek myths with no other cultures even getting a look in, by a God installed by chance and his own wealth in life who will brook no challenges to his power. Dodge In Hell, indeed.

            <content type="html">
    
        The Breath Mints.
    
    
    On July 25, 2021, I took a bus to visit my mom for the first time since the pandemic struck and everyone went into lockdown around March 2020. My favorite Blaseball team, the Breath Mints, had just had an incredibly successful in-game election. We’d picked up an amazing four blessings for our team, recruiting legendary pitcher Uncle Plasma to the rotation once again after he was Vaulted following our incredible heist nine seasons back; doubling all RBIs of Rodriguez Internet, one of our most consistent batters; and moving Winnie Hess — our large, powerful horse, by raw stat numbers almost certainly the best player in the Internet League — from our rotation to our lineup so she could take a shot at batting. It was sure to be an exciting Season 24; perhaps we’d even win another championship to go along with the one two seasons ago when we put together probably the best team the Internet League had ever seen.
Almost immediately, the season did prove to be exciting. In her first game batting, Winnie successfully stole home off a single… twice. And in her third game, under the weird shadow of an eclipse across the brilliant colors of the recently supernova’d Sun(Sun), the Breath Mints were incinerated by a rogue umpire and the entire team replaced with the Oxford Paws. In the end, the Mints fans’ mantra “The Breath Mints are immune to consequences” held true, in a perversely limited way. The only two players who had been Breath Mints since season 1, Leach Ingram and Rodriguez Internet, were Fireproof, and so were also the only ones to survive the inferno.
As seen in the spartan text-based interface on the official Blaseball website, the incineration of the Breath Mints happened with no fanfare. In the bottom of the fifth, with two outs and Jode Preston on first, Rodriguez Internet stepped up to bat for the Mints.



Five seconds later, a single message announced the incineration, introduced the Paws, and declared that Leach and Rod would be playing for them now.



Five seconds after that, no one watching the game who didn’t recognize the name Rodriguez Internet would have any idea that the Kansas City Breath Mints had ever existed.



Nowhere has the dichotomy that characterizes Blaseball — between the raw, unsentimental facts of the game and the thriving, passionate community around it — been starker than in the responseThe impact of the incineration was tempered somewhat by an official announcement on the Blaseball Discord at the beginning of the season, which warned: “The community you have built with your teams will not disappear. This is a plot point for this era, not your team disappearing forever on the Discord or the Website.” It took the edge off the shock of the team’s disappearance to know it wouldn’t be forever, but the announcement was vague enough in other respects that there was (and still is) a lot of uncertainty about in what capacity the team would continue to exist.

 to the Mints’ incineration on the official Blaseball Discord server. #tic-tactics, the channel normally used for strategy discussion, was repurposed into #sentimints, and accumulated fifteen thousand words of “big sentimental posts” from over a hundred different people about what the community meant to them. A few hundred of those words were mine, but I wouldn’t get a chance to write them for several hours.
When I found out about the incineration, I was in the middle of a board game with my mom and my brother. I had to focus on three quarters of an entire ass game of Wingspan while having complicated and weird feelings about the demise of an imaginary splorts [sic] team. And when I tried to explain why I was so distracted, I found myself at a loss. It was still too fresh, and too weird. I guess that some of what I felt was a kind of grief. But on the other hand, to quote one of the Mints chat’s most beloved memes…



Still, I’d been really looking forward to actually following what was shaping up to be a fun season, with Winnie absolutely stampeding around the bases every chance she got and maybe the rest of the Breath Mints also doing neat things occasionally too. Like when we stole another team’s Party TimePer the Enhanced Party Time rule, instituted in Season 6: “When a team is mathematically eliminated from the Postseason, they’ll have a chance of receiving random permanent stat boosts during their games.”

 with our ballpark’s PsychoAcoustics“In Feedback or Reverb, PsychoAcoustics will occasionally Echo one of the Away Team’s mods to the Home Team, for game-long use.”

 renovation and got two illegal parties without being eliminated from playoffs yet. Or when Marquez Clark somehow stole home twice in a single inning. Oh, what about when Jon Halifax hit a home run in the top of the ninth that the Equal Sun ruleInstituted in Season 22, the Equal Sun rule stated: “A home run during a game’s final out ties the game.”

 made a 20.2-run homer, turning a game that the Mints had been losing 20.3 – 0.1 into a game that we won 20.300000000000001 – 20.3 due to Blaseball’s first and only game-deciding floating point error? And let’s not forget that time in the final game of the season 22 championship, when Leach Ingram came back from ElsewhereIn a type of weather called “Flooding,” players on base would occasionally be swept away. Sometimes they would just return to the lineup, but sometimes they would be swept “Elsewhere” and removed from play for anywhere from a few innings to several seasons.

 in the bottom of the 8th and hit a home run to break a tie and give the Mints our first and only championship win!Making this even funnier, the Mints would have won even without that homer, due to the Sun 30 rule, which stated: “When a game enters Extra Innings, both Teams will immediately earn 1 Win.”


These moments were all thrilling on their own, though of course on the Blaseball website, as with the Mints’ incineration, they happened with little fanfare. But they each also drew from and fed back into a rich history from hundreds of previous Blaseball games. Marquez Clark was a once-decent player who’d been reduced to easily the worst batter in the Mints’ lineup by a truly grotesque series of misfortunes

 when he pulled off his amazing feat somehow. Jon Halifax was roundly loathed by Breath Mints fans for his general mediocrity and unwanted position as leadoff hitter, but despised even more by the Crabs, who’d foisted him off on us at the beginning of the season… and against whom he hit his record-breaking, unprecedented home run. (All this made it even funnier when he was incinerated in a game shortly later in the same series against the Crabs.) And Leach Ingram, the OG Breath Mint so beloved by fans that I was inspired to write a song about her, was universally understood by the Mints to be a lazy dirtbag whose whole vibe was coasting on as little effort as possible. So her cruising back into the championships after an extended break at almost the last possible moment to hit a series-winning-but-not-really homer was perhaps the most iconic Leach moment in a career full of them. (Leach was also the recipient — or perpetrator? — of one of our two PsychoAcoustics-enabled illicit parties, naturally.)
And so imagine a bunch of nerds in a chat room getting Sports Rowdy during each one of these events, hooting and hollering in text and possibly also real life. Every wild thing that happens to the Mints is grist for the mill of the fans’ creativity and appetite for jokes,Or, in the parlance of the contemporary Internet in general and the Breath Mints chat in particular, “bits.”

 and it’s not uncommon to pop into chat and find everyone furiously iterating on some new fever dream of an in-joke (which they will be happy to explain to anyone who’s out of the loop, to the extent that it’s explicable by human intellect). We all know, now, that the concept of a “sports nerd” is not such an oxymoron as was once thought, but Blaseball, with its bare-bones presentation, really encourages the imagination to run wild in a way that the typically stat-centric nature of traditional sports nerdery often doesn’t allow for. And of course, even if stats are what you’re into, Blaseball has plenty of room for that: in addition to everything afforded by the real-world sport it’s based on, one need only recall the 20.3 – 20.3 Mints win to get an idea of the possibilities for trivia opened up by a mutable ruleset and potentially buggy software.
What’s missing from Blaseball the website, I guess, is just that none of the players really have personalities, except as expressed through their gameplay, which in turn is determined by their stats. But that just means that fans have to look elsewhere for the human element. For me — and, I suspect, most people — that means the community of real people following along beside me, cheering for these little boxes of numbers in their simulated games, imagining up the world in which they live in real time.
It’s why my grief at the Mints’ incineration was so weird and qualified and hard to explain. Obviously all the incinerated players were made up, and while I was fond of them and the narrative that the community had constructed around them, I wasn’t overly attached to them. In fact, the Breath Mints’ primer slide deck for new fans (don’t laugh, it’s very helpful!!!) explicitly warns against becoming so:

We want to discourage intense and extreme attachments to players who may get incinerated or stolen at any time. don’t get us wrong–we love our players! but developing them as a community helps us stay grounded in the real reason we’re here–each other.

I can think of no better compliment to the Breath Mints fan community and the people who have worked to shape it than to affirm the truth of this. Blaseball is currently on hiatus for an indeterminate amount of time, probably at least a few months, but the community remains. Without it, all the wild stories that come out of Blaseball are just amusing anecdotes. Experienced in a virtual room full of fellow nerds, they’re cherished memories, opportunities for bonding, seeds of inspiration for bits and stories and music and art. It’s weird and I love it and I can’t wait to see what it looks like when it comes back.

        Wingspan&#39;s Brilliant Learning Mechanism
    
    
    Recently I played Wingspan with my mom and brother. My brother and I had played it before, but it had been a while, and my mom had never played it. My mom is not a particularly experienced modern board game player — though I think she picks things up quicker than she gives herself credit for — and Wingspan is not a simple game. But she was able to learn it remarkably smoothly thanks to an ingenious teaching mechanism: an instruction sheet with a fixed setup that completely prescribes all actions taken by all players for the first four turns.
It’s such a good idea I was shocked in retrospect that I’d never seen any other game do it. By removing all players’ agency in the very early game, it also removes the anxiety about having to make what are often some of a game’s most important strategic decisions when you least understand what’s going on. But it also lets the designers choose the opening moves to demonstrate as wide a variety of the game’s mechanics as possible.
Learning a game can be a tough hurdle even for seasoned gamers and this is the most effective onboarding I’ve ever seen, pun intended. The next time I find myself having to teach someone a new game, I’ll definitely consider putting together a first few turns on rails like Wingspan has. Actually, a repository of such game training wheels would be a good idea for a website. Who wants to make a website?

            <updated>2021-02-07T06:51:00Z</updated>
            
            
            <content type="html">
    
        Who Wants A 2020 Retrospective?
    
    
    So last year when I wrote a retrospective of 2019, I acknowledged, presciently, that “Non-shitshows are clearly just not on the table anymore,” and 2020 certainly bore that out. But I also said “here’s to me writing a 2020 retrospective before March of 2021,” and now’s my chance to go 2 for 2.
This ended up being very long and mostly about media I consumed. Just a media consumption kind of year, I suppose. I could write more about my thoughts and feelings in 2020, but does the Internet really need another Pandemic Polemic about how COVID-19 revealed, in a way that should be absolutely unequivocal to anyone paying attention, that capitalism is a broken, inhumane system that we’d all be better rid of? Does it need another white man lamenting how America is actually a hell of a lot more racist even than the previous three years had shown it to be, when this actually demonstrates nothing more than his own failure to pay attention? Nope! And that stuff wouldn’t be fun for me to write about anyway, even if I thought I had something new to say about it, which I don’t. So it’s music and video game opinions for you.The Internet doesn’t really need another white man bloviating about the stuff he likes, either, but at least I have some kind of unique personal taste to express here.



Sewing
  
Though I was fortunate not to lose my job in the pandemic, for a while it seemed like the Done Thing was to use the shutdown as an excuse to take up a new hobby and the gusto with which some people did so was infectious. I got the bread baking thing out of my system a few years ago (and anyway by the time I started thinking about a new hobby all the yeast in the United States was gone) so due to some advantageous circumstances I settled on sewing. I’d done a small amount of it by hand before, but my partner actually had a sewing machine that she rarely used, so I took the chance to learn how to use it. Conveniently, masks were also an extremely good low-stakes starter project that could be done simply with old clothes using a pattern such as the one I quickly settled on as the most accessible: Protohaven’s Ally Face Mask. I moved on to hemming a couple pairs of pants and met with considerable success.
Sewing also dovetailed nicely with my decision, extensively and somewhat defensively explained and justified last year, to start wearing skirts. Sewing a skirt seems like the “knitting a scarf” of sewing projects: though there are many different styles of skirts, most of them are fundamentally a tube with a hem at either end, with possible stretch goals like an elastic waistband (pun intended) or pockets. For my first one, essentially a practice skirt, I used a sports jersey kind of fabric and seriously misconstrued the amount of fabric required by the pattern. Unfortunately, a first item of clothing is not the best time to be forced off-script, so it’s too narrow, which I don’t like because I tend to take big steps, and sort of just cheap and sloppy feeling in general.
My second skirt was a decent success, though. I’d picked up a bunch of upholstery fabric samples from a place up the street that was throwing them out, and in an excruciatingly slow and hesitant process, I sewed them together into a patchwork pattern and lined it with a fuzzy fabric that I’d purchased online. The result was quite heavy and fairly stiff, and the shenanigans I resorted to while seam sealing it made the interior look like a bit of a war zone, but the outside looks pretty okay. Ultimately I call it a decent success for a second big project.
Finally, at the very end of the year, I sewed a pair of basically close-fitting sweatpants, to be worn under skirts as an alternative to tights. The tailoring is basically nonexistent: they can be worn forwards or backwards and they look pretty goofy. But they’re not meant to be seen, and they feel fine and are plenty comfy. Not a bad way to wrap up the year in sewing.


Media and such

Music
My music listening ramped up again in 2020, not directly because of the pandemic, but because of the Fridays where Bandcamp, the best music service on the Internet, waived its fees so that musicians would get 100% of the revenue from their sales. These days provided a good excuse for me to blow quite a bit more money on music than I might have otherwise.I do not and will never use Spotify. I recognize I’m in a position of privilege that allows me to spend more money on music than others might be able to, but as someone who enjoys music and wants to support its creation, I can’t countenance a service as musician-hostile as Spotify when an actually ethical alternative like Bandcamp exists. Where possible, I’ll link to albums I mention here on Bandcamp.


Not everything I loved in 2020 was released this year. PUP’s Morbid Stuff is a much more “dudes yelling” kind of affair than what I usually listen to, but what can I say? It makes being worn out and at the end of your rope feel like a party, which I’m sure we can all get behind this year, at least in principle. This album also gives me strong The Dismemberment Plan Is Terrified vibes in places, though it’s generally more melodic and less chaotic.
Speaking of “chaotic,” I also got pretty into 100 Gecs’s 2019 album 1000 Gecs this year, inspired by — what else? — people making jokes about them on the internet. The affection in the jokes was so palpable that it was enticing rather than off-putting, and my first listen to 1000 Gecs made me laugh out loud at its freewheeling audacity. It cleverly front-loads three of its catchiest but also most gimmicky tracks, all of which end with a hairpin turn into a blast of hilariously blown-out noise, but it doesn’t lag in quality for its entire 27-minute runtime. (I count the two sound collages “I Need Help Immediately” and “gecgecgec” in this, since they work so well as interludes that break up the sensory overload of the rest of it.)
I’ll be mentioning the spectacular Singles Jukebox again later in this post because whenever I want to read about a song I’m particularly enjoying, someone in their deep roster of writers has almost always said something vivid or delightfully on point. Jonathan Bradley opened his review of Money Machine with the following:

What I love about 100 gecs is the self-erasing sense of abandon in their commitment to shittiness: their constant doubling-down on their worst instincts, their ugliest sounds, and their stupidest ideas captures a vivid nihilism that strikes awe in its ability to destroy indiscriminately.

I’m not sure I agree that “nihilism” is the way to characterize this music but there definitely is a so-bad-it-wraps-around-to-good quality about it. Case in point: that review concluded with a score of 9 out of 10 from Bradley, but from the excerpt, it could just have easily have been a 2. That’s 100 Gecs for you.
Let’s move on to 2020 and get that other Singles Jukebox quote out of the way, since it was there that Katherine St. Asaph hit the nail on the head regarding Fiona Apple’s extremely good but still somehow overhyped Fetch the Bolt Cutters:

My stance: The Idler Wheel is Fiona Apple’s masterpiece, the genius coronation should have happened then, and in happening belatedly it happened for an album that, while good, is lesser… As Apple as a composer and vocalist has grown more freewheeling, less predictable, Apple as a lyricist has grown more didactic, not always for the better.

It’s strange: The Idler Wheel was my favorite album of 2012, and I don’t like Fetch the Bolt Cutters quite as much, largely for the reason St. Asaph mentions. But “Cosmonauts,” which seems like the song here that wouldn’t have been out of place on The Idler Wheel, is possibly my least favorite. And despite that I don’t generally care for more didactic lyrics, I do like Fetch the Bolt Cutters’s loose but clear overarching theme of solidarity, of women breaking age-old cycles that make them hurt each other for no good reason. I guess I just like the concept better than the execution, whereas the opposite was the case with The Idler Wheel (if it even had any kind of unifying concept). So my favorite tracks, despite that they lay their cards on the table quite clearly, are mostly the ones that lean into that concept: “Shameika,” “Ladies” and the title track.
So given that I was underwhelmed by Fetch the Bolt Cutters — though I did like it, don’t get me wrong — what were my favorite albums that came out in 2020?
I’ve liked Waxahatchee since 2013’s Cerulean Salt, though her intervening albums Ivy Tripp and Out in the Storm didn’t do quite as much for me. So I wasn’t expecting to be blown away by her new one Saint Cloud, especially after listening to the lead single “Lilacs” and hearing more of a country-ish, Americana-ish sound than I was prepared for, those genres being ones I’ve never really managed to crack. But it turned out that having as familiar a voice as Katie Crutchfield’s adopt just enough of a twang and no more was a good way to ease me into the stylistic mode of this albumJohn Darnielle accomplished a similar feat on “Waylon Jennings Live!” off last year’s In League With Dragons. Though he mercifully did not attempt to affect a twang, that song’s instrumental and melody leaned way harder into the country western idiom than anything on Saint Cloud.

. And I’m very glad it did, because she’s really firing on all cylinders here, using a fuller sound than on any of her previous albums to animate some of her absolute best songwriting. It’s front-loaded with the catchier stuff, which I usually hate, but the tail end of it is just a bit more somber and contemplative without dragging in quality at all. Just an absolutely wonderful album, fully deserving all the praise that’s been heaped upon it.
I also grew to love Bartees Strange’s Live Forever pretty quickly, for an album with so many different styles and influences on it that it’s difficult to pin down. Strange (né Cox) is a guy whose origin story in the popular imagination seems to be “the only Black guy at the National concert.”I don’t mean to be reductive with this; it’s basically the angle taken in the promotional materials for Bartees Strange’s first EP Say Goodbye to Pretty Boy, which includes five covers of National songs. It’s a good hook but doesn’t fully do justice to the skill of his songwriting or the thoughtfulness of his approach even to those covers; I recommend reading the full description of the linked EP for a fuller picture of that.

 But Live Forever pulls from more widespread sources than that description might suggest to create something really vibrant, surprising and thought-provoking.
I keep thinking about lead single “Mustang” and how it relates to Bartees Strange’s inhabiting very white indie-rock spaces (indie rock itself, of course, having a lineage originating in Black music). Given that Mustang is the name of the “overwhelmingly white and racist sundown town on the outskirts of Oklahoma City”Per Live Forever’s press materials.

 that Cox grew up in, it’s hard not to hear a line like “You’re screaming and cursing / I’m smiling / You’re killing me” as reflective of the experience of growing up Black in such a place. And given that Black people have been making art about such experiences for decades, and since that line is a near-exact interpolation of one in an Antlers song about an abusive relationship, appearing just before the kind of anthemic chorus you might hear in, say, a National song, it’s also hard not to hear it as a sort of plea: if I speak about this in your language, will you actually hear me?
Bartees Cox has said in several interviews that it shouldn’t be so rare or weird for there to be Black people in indie rock, or rock in general. But since it is still uncommon, it makes an already excellent album like Live Forever both more exciting and more meaningful.
Less genre-crossing and more just straightforwardly well-executed was Phoebe Bridgers’s Punisher. At first it sounded like just a middle-of-the-road folk album with some interesting and effective production flourishes, like the otherworldly reversed-sounding guitar line in “Garden Song” or the slight vocoder-y vocal effect in the title track. But a closer listen kept uncovering more sweet, wistful melodies and striking turns of phrase: “I’m gonna kill you / If you don’t beat me to it” (“Kyoto”). “A copycat killer with a chemical cut / Either I’m careless or I want to get caught” (“Punisher”). “Swore I could feel you through the walls / But that’s impossible” (“Chinese Satellite,” emphasis present in the line’s delivery). “I hate your mom / I hate it when she opens her mouth” (“ICU”). The kind of lines that really draw me in: what’s she talking about?

Extremely Honorable Mentions
People in my family were all asking me for music recommendations, so I’m going to basically plagiarize my own email to them for other albums that I loved in 2020 but maybe a bit less then my top 3 above.
leon chang, return to bird world. An album which is a soundtrack to a video game which doesn’t exist, which is itself a sequel to another nonexistent video game which had its own soundtrack. The first bird world was fun but this one is just as good if not better and there’s even more of it. Despite that it’s pretty light and fluffy sounding, it’s also (to my ears) really compositionally and harmonically complex and interesting.
Open Mike Eagle, Anime, Trauma and Divorce. This is a very funny rapper’s account of his terrible, horrible, no good, very bad year, which was apparently actually 2019 though this album came out late in 2020. OME has done a lot of good stuff and I think this is one of his strongest albums. Most of the tracks on here are a mix between the total despondency of “everything ends last year” and the wisecracking of “wtf is self care” but I like those two as the extremes on either end of the range that this album sits in.
R.A.P. Ferreira, purple moonlight pages. R.A.P. Ferreira used to be known as milo but changed his stage name sometime in the last few years. I haven’t listened as closely to this as I want to yet, but every time I put it on I’m struck by how often he reminds me of Kool A.D. but with better quality control. This album is dense but I like “LAUNDRY” as a more plain-spoken (pun intended) way in. Hard to pick a fav though as this is pretty consistent.
Destroyer, Have We Met. I’m a longtime Destroyer fan, and this is one of my favorite Destroyer albums in a while. Big kinda 80s synth vibe to this, but no one writes an opaque-but-still-engaging lyric like Dan Bejar and he’s in fine form here. I don’t know if the opener “Crimson Tide” is the best thing here, necessarily, but it’s up there, and it’s certainly this album in a nutshell. Shout out, also, to “It Just Doesn’t Happen,” which despite that I can basically never make heads or tails of Destroyer lyrics, contains my favorite lyric of any song in 2020: “I find the silence unbearable / What does that say about the silence.”
The Mountain Goats, Getting Into Knives. Another band I’ve been into for years and years. This album is very good, not their best; a couple tracks would be skippable for me if I ever skipped tracks. For uptempo songs I think I prefer the more abstruse “As Many Candles As Possible” to the lively and horns-driven but straightforward lead single “Get Famous.” For chiller tracks I love the series of snapshots of a cross-country trip in the melodic “Picture of My Dress” and the subtle but unmistakable menace in the superficially pleasant-sounding title track and album closer.
Owen Pallett, Island. A sequel of sorts to a previous high-concept album. From the first track, which spaces out about 80 piano notes across three minutes, it’s clear this is gonna be a moody album, but it’s really rewarded repeat listening for me and it’s not as dour as that intro makes it seem. Pallett plays a lot of guitar on this, which surprised me at first, but they’re still an amazing composer and arranger and both the fully soundtrack-esque treatment of “A Bloody Morning” and the tone-block flourishes on more straight-up folk songs like “Fire-Mare” are magnificent.
Carly Rae Jepsen - Dedicated Side B. I started dipping my toe into pop music a bit last year with Side A of this album. Side B is more of the same - really catchy, light and frothy pop music with a couple possible duds. Opener “This Love Isn’t Crazy” is probably one of the best tracks here, just a real sugar blast. But I also like “Heartbeat” a surprising amount for how mellow it is. The album has the strange decision to put two versions of the same track (“Felt This Way” and “Stay Away”) back to back, which I found confusing at first, but it’s grown on me as the distinctions between the two songs became clearer.


Other Releases From Previous Years I Liked In 2020
Moonface, This One’s For The Dancer &amp; This One’s For The Dancer’s Bouquet (2018). Very long, as it’s basically two albums interspersed with each other, but those two albums are so sonically different it holds my interest for the whole runtime. The “Minotaur” songs are generally my favorites, somewhat surprisingly, based as they are on what I think my brother — who initially pushed this album on me — called “mallet percussion” (vibraphone, marimba, steel drums, etc.) and vocoder’d vocals. “Minotaur Forgiving Knossos” is the closest thing to a single and an easy song to love.
Christine and the Queens, Chris (2019). I got pretty into this for a couple months and then put it down but I’m still pretty fond of it. Dancey, synth-y pop music but with really fascinating lyrics about gender, aggression and alienation — and there’s a whole alternate version with the lyrics in French! For a song about despair, the melody in “Doesn’t Matter” is such a jam.


Musical To-Do List
Finally, some albums that I listened to a few times and liked ok, but not enough to say anything substantial about them, and that I want to revisit in 2021:

Run the Jewels, RTJ4. This certainly doesn’t seem to be of any lower quality than their previous stuff, but I might be at a point of diminishing returns with these guys.
Moses Sumney, græ. Definitely a demanding listen. I think it’s probably worth the effort but I haven’t cracked it yet.
Fleet Foxes, Shore. Pleasant enough, but nothing on it has really grabbed me yet.
The Microphones, Microphones in 2020. Another demanding listen. 37 minutes of continuous narrative is a pretty big commitment, attention-wiseAnd that’s after you get past the seven minutes spent strumming two chords.

, and the more I listen to this the more I fear it’s a bit too explicitly navel-gazey to be worth it for me.



Captivating Performances on YouTube
There are some incredible musical performances on YouTube. Here are a few that I found fascinating in 2020:

bbymutha performing “Heavy Metal” for COLORS. COLORS is an absolutely spectacular series of single-song shows which puts each performer in a room with colored walls and a mic and that’s about it. So they tend to sink or swim on the charisma of the performance. bbymutha just spits straight fire with studied insouciance for 150 seconds here, and it’s the filthiest and most transfixing performance I’ve seen since Azealia Banks’s “212” video.
Another COLORS show: JPEGMAFIA’s performance of “Thug Tears”. I’m still working out how I feel about JPEGMAFIA in general; he’s definitely got huge personality and tremendously forward-thinking beats and rapping, but his albums are a bit too sensory overload for casual listening. This single song is a perfect amount to take in, though. Whereas bbymutha’s COLORS performance was lowercase, JPEGMAFIA’s is spellbindingly all-caps, a stark contrast to the much chiller album version of this track. Over a glitchy, constantly confounding beat, Peggy dispenses histrionics with laser precision: he screams into the mic, looks on the verge of tears, vamps outrageously, and caps the whole thing off with a perfectly timed… well. Just watch it. I cannot stop watching when I put this video on.
mclusky’s “To Hell With Good Intentions” is a compact, snotty classic chunk of nasty noise. July Talk’s cover somehow manages to improve on the original in some ways, bumping the tempo a little and bringing a different, more focused kind of intensity to the lead vocal. There’s nothing groundbreaking about it but it’s another video I can’t stop watching thanks to the overwhelming energy of the performances.
My friend linked me an artist named Shawn Wasabi who performs lively and involved music — sort of halfway between 100 Gecs and bird world — on a grid of 64 (or, sometimes, 16) indistinguishable circles. His videos keep the focus on his hands, where it belongs, and they are fascinating. I almost can’t imagine how one would learn to perform something like this in real time; when I do imagine it, though, the dedication it must take seems off the charts.
In 2007, Owen Pallett performed a cover of Destroyer’s “An Actor’s Revenge” which was so nice he had to do it twice, the second time with a special guest. OK, I’ll spoil it: the special guest is Dan Bejar, looking like he’s having as much fun as he’s ever had in his life, which is to say: a tiny, nearly imperceptible amount of fun. Clearly the gleeful exuberance of the other two participants is such that it breaks down even the defenses of Mr. “I’m not really into funny shit” himself.
Moving a little further out into the realm of the esoteric, this Zs performance is probably actually a pretty standard one as far as Zs performances go, but it’s notable for being a decent recording, which seem to be in short supply. Here they’re playing the last three songs on their 2015 LP Xe. Zs plays pretty “difficult” music but it’s still remarkable to see it performed. The transitions between uncannily precise rhythms and free-jazz freakout breakdowns in the opening twelve-minute “Corps” are seamless and astounding. So are the jarring shifts between the mechanical-sounding substrate that makes up most of “Xe,” its outbreaks of thudding cacophony, and the melody that gradually appears, as though fighting to be heard amidst all the other goings-on. Every transition between the three motifs seems to happen at random, but the three band members execute it in lockstep every time, with no sheet music and only infrequent eye contact to indicate they’re even playing the same song. It’s often atonal and occasionally quite a squall, but also virtuosic and fascinating to watch.
Out in the far realms of unlistenability, there’s this totally bewildering performance of a Brian Ferneyhough piece by Séverine Ballon, on an absolute punching bag of a solo cello and with some electronics that amount, as far as I can tell, to some several-second delay on some portions of the piece. The piece itself feels like it’s pushing the serialism of Boulez to the breaking point: maybe there’s some structure buried in thereIn fact there almost certainly is some structure. Samuel Andreyev, who has a wonderful channel in which he analyzes some incredibly recondite music, gives a Ferneyhough string trio the old college try in this video. It’s about as straightforward as you’d expect from listening to the piece.

, but it’s abstracted beyond recognition to a casual listener such as myself. But it’s also dynamic to the point that the performance could be easily described as athletic. Ballon scrapes and slaps the cello’s strings, whaps its body for percussion, plays pizzicato and harmonics, and then finally actually picks up her bow two and a half minutes in, whereupon things really get interesting. Overall, the amount of concentration required of the page turner seems superhuman, to say nothing of Ballon herself, and while the music is obviously way out in the outer reaches of modern incomprehensibility, it’s amazing to watch it performed.
Reeling it in a little, there’s Zebra Katz’s video for “Ish”. I’m not gay and I don’t go to clubs, so I’m trusting the word of various Internet denizens that this is basically gay club music. The bass certainly sounds like it would rattle the eardrums of anyone in a club playing it, and Katz certainly dances like a man possessed in the video, but there’s something more to this video: I don’t think I’m misreading it to say Katz and the director are bringing some real creepy, unsettling energy here. But it’s captivating too, so here it is.
Finally, and maybe most normie, there’s this Phoebe Bridgers + Arlo Parks cover of Radiohead’s “Fake Plastic Trees.” It lacks the showiness of basically everything else in this list. But few people these days do sad like Phoebe Bridgers, Arlo Parks is a lovely pianist and harmonizer, and this is just a quiet stunner of a cover song.




Games
I don’t know if I played more games in 2020 than in previous years, or just put more effort into writing about them. But this section is considerably longer than it’s been for the last couple years. Where possible, I’ll link to the actual website for games I mention. Failing that, I’ll link to itch.io, the Bandcamp of PC games.

Roguelikes and Thoughts Thereon
Continuing in my tradition of playing mostly roguelikes or -litesHenceforth just “roguelikes,” in the broad sense of procedurally generated games with permadeath, with or without metaprogression. I’m aware of the contoversy surrounding this term, this is how I’m using it here, don’t @ me.

, I enjoyed Dead Cells a lot. But I already wrote about that.
Like everyone else in the world, I also played Hades and loved it: all its gods and mortals are so charmingly rendered that you just want to keep spending time with and developing your relationships with them. So while the core gameplay loop is engaging and well-executed, I think where Hades really raised the bar for video games is in its successful marriage of narrative and procedural generation. So many other roguelikes have sketchy storylines: some that might be interesting but are only hinted at or dispensed in scraps without getting in the way of the gameplaySee: Dead Cells, Nuclear Throne, The Binding of Isaac.

, some that are basically just generic and uninteresting skeletons to hang a game onSee: almost all roguelikes, honestly, but Crypt of the NecroDancer, Slay The Spire and Rogue Legacy as a few high profile examples. You get it, if you know any of these games. The same kind of “story” the original Super Mario Bros. had.

. Hades was probably the first roguelike I’m aware of to really put its story front and center and succeed. I take some issue with how it drags its game-ness out even after its own epilogue; this was easily solved, in my case, by simply not playing anymore rather than submitting to the Heat grind, but I wish it had just ended, decisively, rather than petering out in this “until you get bored” kind of way.
I guess that Dead Cells, and before it Nuclear Throne, had a similar kind of unsatisfying deflation when I stopped playing them, but it maybe took Hades, a game that seemed more like it could have had a real end, to make me realize that I don’t like how most roguelikes end. Because most of them don’t. Either you hit some kind of skill cap, where it becomes too much of a grind to make any further progress, or you “finish” the game and it contrives a flimsy-at-best excuse for you to keep playing, and then you do until you don’t anymore.
I get that some better or more dedicated players than I might get some satisfaction out of getting to 32 Heat in Hades, or finishing Ascension 20 in Slay the Spire, or getting all the achievements in basically any game ever released on Steam. But for those of us without the time or skill or both to get to that point, this type of “post-game” content can feel like just more filler that keeps the game from being a complete and bounded experience. I don’t know if I’m explaining this well. I just know that I can’t think of a roguelike that I stopped playing because I felt like it was finished. I always just kind of stopped.
Anyway: I played a few other roguelikes in 2020, none of which were an exception to the above. I bounced off Caves of Qud pretty quickly: it was too opaque and punishing, and had the same problem as ADOM: an overly prescribed early game that has you doing one of a few “starter quests” repeatedly as you get the hang of things. I might have to try it again at some point, but the prospect feels similar to trying to get into Dwarf Fortress.
In some ways, Children of Morta is a less-refined Hades. Like Hades, it’s procgen but with heavy meta-progression and a story-centric approach to the genre. But its pixel art and gameplay are a bit rougher and a lot more generic, its characters and story somewhat less compelling. Still, it was worth playing all the way through. I haven’t dipped into the New Game+ that was released after I “finished” but I’m suspicious that it’s more of the content-itis I mentioned above.
Wizard of Legend and Moonlighter are pretty much your standard story-lite action-roguelikes in the vein of Rogue Legacy and ilk. The latter’s shopkeeping mechanic is cute and equal parts fun and tedious, but the story is nothing and the game as a whole is a fairly “numbers go up” randomized-Zelda-dungeon affair. It has a New Game+, of course, but I couldn’t see the appeal at all. Wizard of Legend leans more to the “action” side of the spectrum, forgoing story pretty much entirely, and is a somewhat “purer” gaming experience for it, but still feels mostly like a time-killer. I found the bosses somewhat overwhelmingly difficult, though I did manage to beat it (again, notwithstanding the post-game whatever), and your choices of equipment seemed to suffer from too much breadth.
Gerty worked surprisingly well for me, considering how slow-paced it seemed initially: the digging-centric navigation was novel in an action-roguelike and it felt a bit different from most of the other top-down games I’ve played recently. Still, the main “story” was over pretty quickly, and by that time I just wasn’t enjoying it enough to try for the better ending that I assume it was possible to get by jumping through certain hoops in a normal playthrough.
Steredenn is a procedurally generated shmup. I liked it a lot but got pretty hung up on the big difficulty spikes on the last two bosses. And since the boss fights are basically the same every time, this took a lot away from what I enjoy about procgen and led to a sort of stressful experience wanting to get the right set of equipment for just those bosses by the time I reached them. In much the same vein, Lazy Galaxy: Rebel Story had a surprising amount of story for the type of game it was. Like with Hades, I found myself drawn in by the interactions between the characters, who in this case come from wildly different backgrounds but all have a common enemy. The writing was either clumsy or poorly translated in a lot of cases, but I found it pretty charming nonetheless, and played it quite a bit more than the wildly unbalanced gameplay might have otherwise warranted.


Non-Roguelikes
I finally played Kentucky Route Zero. It’s kind of the opposite of the roguelikes mentioned in the previous section, as far as “gameplay” goes, but pretty engrossing in its own way. There’s a lot to analyze about it, and other people have done so extensively enough that I don’t feel I have anything to contribute. But even without picking it apart, and even though I never really cottoned on to magical realism, it’s affecting, and its atmosphere is probably unmatched among any game I’ve ever played.
Steven Universe: Save the Light was charmingly animated and a surprisingly decent Super Mario RPG-esqueBy which I mean, basically a JRPG but with: some light platforming and treasure hunting during map traversal, encounters visible (and in some cases avoidable) on maps, and timing and other minigame-esque elements during battles.

 JRPG. But I don’t have too much patience for JRPG tropes anymore, the small number of vocalizations for the characters quickly became tiresome, and its story failed to capture what made Steven Universe special. I got near the end but didn’t finish it.
SteamWorld: Dig 2 was fine. Like the first, it was plenty engrossing during its playtime, but didn’t improve on its predecessor in any notable ways.
I played far more of Starbound than I think it warranted. It was the first game I think I’ve ever played that really goes hard on the open world / resource collection / crafting thing, and I think I got caught up enough in that loop to overlook how the environments are all kind of samey, the platforming and combat all kind of janky, the crafting and building all kind of tedious and pointless. I think it was worth getting some experience with the genre, but I doubt this particular game is an exemplar of the form, and regardless, I think it’s probably a type of game I should avoid in the future.
Lenna’s Inception is a gem of a game. On Mastodon I described it, somewhat pithily if I do say so myself, as “Undertale – EarthBound + The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.” I stand by that description now, although the last part of the equation would be much more accurate if replaced by the Link to the Past randomizer. It’s a charming little thing, worthy of playing through once and then, if you’re anything like me, immediately a second time to make sure you see all there is to see of the quite surprising story. The procedural generationDespite having procgen I don’t consider Lenna’s Inception a roguelike, as it lacks permadeath.

 means that the world and dungeons lack character, but it also makes playthroughs after the first go down easier. This review makes a good, detailed case for the game’s general excellence, and the dev wrote an interesting postmortem about the development and marketing.
Speaking of gems, and charming little things, Butterfly Soup is another game that is both. It’s a straight up visual novel that is, per its developer, “about gay asian girls playing baseball and falling in love.” That’s true, but it doesn’t really do justice to how sharply the game captures the banter of a bunch of precocious high schoolers, or how deftly it balances that banter with the pressure cookers of their home lives. It’s frequently laugh-out-loud funny, a little bit obnoxious in that way that high schoolers are, and just sincere enough to be moving without being maudlin. And it’ll only take you a few hours to play through. And it’s pay-what-you-want. You should just play it.



Some Closing Stuff
I mentioned TV in previous years, but there wasn’t really anything I felt strongly enough about in 2020 to write about a lot. The Good Place, which I didn’t finish up until it showed up on Netflix, wrapped up satisfactorily, but its fourth season was even less thrilling than its third. It was fine. Those first two seasons were lightning in a bottle. She-Ra also finished up well and cutely enough but didn’t leave a lasting impact. Carmen Sandiego was fun and had style in spades but needed more mytharc and less Heist of the Week, to borrow some X-Files terminology, plus it had a pretty bad case of Mary Sue-ism and required a bit more suspension of disbelief than I was able to maintain.
I didn’t read for shit in 2020. Probably the most interesting thing I read was Ijeoma Oluo’s So You Want To Talk About Race, and I think I’d already read enough about race in places on the internet that not a lot in it was really eye-opening to me. I read it and talked about it with a bunch of other white people and signed up for a local mutual aid Patreon and started being more liberal with my money when fundraisers for Black folks would come up on my timeline on Mastodon. I’ll be the first to admit I’m not doing a lot, but I’m not doing nothing.
And that’s it! I started writing this damn thing like two weeks ago and I’m tired of it. If I have anything else to say about 2020, I’ll say it later in 2021.

        A System Font Stack
    
    
    Allow me to indulge for a bit in some bloviating about the design of this blog, the thing that bloggers love most to do. I suppressed it when I carried out a pretty significant redesign a while ago, doing away with the “blueprint” gimmick that—while cute—confined the content to a tiny rectangle and locked me into a color scheme that I didn’t love and that played poorly with light themes. This enabled me to

Switch colors to favor purples and teals, a combination I’ve always liked.
Implement light and dark themes using the new-ish prefers-color-scheme CSS feature, along with some judicious use of custom properties.
Change the fonts to something more purple-and-teal-esque, using the round, friendly Bariol Serif and Noway from atipo foundry.

But the more I thought about it, the less able I felt to justify loading like, hundreds of KBs of fonts to display a few KBs of text. For what? Branding? Let’s be real here.
So I’ve switched to a font stack that relies on fonts already installed on your system, though not the defaults that “system font stack” often refers to. Much as I like having a reasonably minimalist web site, I’ve also always enjoyed the aesthetics of fonts, so I do like to exercise a little agency in what things look like. I’m sticking with the sans serif body text, but switching to the widely available Optima (for Macs) and Candara (for more recent Windows machines) with a hodgepodge of fallbacks for various Linux systems. They’re a little more austere and less friendly and playful than Noway Round was, but they still look fine. Headers are still serifs, using the classic Baskerville which is widely available on both Mac and Windows machines, falling back to Microsoft’s Constantia and then to Georgia, one of the OG webfonts, where necessary.
Here are the full CSS declarations, with many of the fallbacks taken from The New System Font Stack:
body {
  font-family:
      Optima,
      Candara,
      &#34;Linux Biolinum&#34;,
      &#34;Libertinus Sans&#34;,
      -apple-system,
      BlinkMacSystemFont,
      &#34;Segoe UI&#34;,
      Cantarell,
      &#34;Helvetica Neue&#34;,
      Helvetica,
      Ubuntu,
      Roboto,
      &#34;Oxygen-Sans&#34;,
      Noto,
      Arial,
      sans-serif,
      &#34;Apple Color Emoji&#34;,
      &#34;Segoe UI Emoji&#34;,
      &#34;Segoe UI Symbol&#34;;
}

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, subtitle {
  font-family:
      Baskerville,
      Constantia,
      Georgia,
      &#34;Droid Serif&#34;,
      &#34;Times New Roman&#34;,
      &#34;Source Serif Pro&#34;,
      serif,
      &#34;Apple Color Emoji&#34;,
      &#34;Segoe UI Emoji&#34;,
      &#34;Segoe UI Symbol&#34;;
  font-weight: bold;
}

Other References and Rejected Alternatives
I also referred heavily to Wikipedia for information about fonts included with MacOS and Windows. I really like the friendly old workhorse Trebuchet MS as well as what seems to me its spiritual successor Calibri, but Trebuchet MS seems to be a little heaver than I prefer, especially for a dark theme, and I couldn’t find any good Calibri equivalents with high Mac support. On the other hand, Optima and Candara seemed to have a similar character (pun intended) and also a possibly somewhat widely available Linux counterpart in Linux Biolinum.
Also, despite that I’m no longer using them here, I do really love Atipo’s fonts. They’re great looking and the price is right.

        My (Current) Favorite Game, My Favorite Critic: A Case Study
    
    
    My latest thing is playing the shit out of Dead Cells, finally. Procedurally generated games are en vogue to the point where they’re practically a meme, which I guess makes me practically a meme for enjoying them so much, but what can I say? Roguelikes, or roguelites (though Dead Cells doesn’t feel particularly “lite”), or procedurally generated death labyrinths, or whatever you want to call them, are the genre that I find the most engaging, and Dead Cells is a pretty archetypal example of what the genre looks like when done well.
However: Dead Cells was also my favorite videogame critic’s fifth worst game of 2018. Tevis Thompson writes, in addition to some great long-form criticism and meta-criticism, a lot of short game reviews that rely on his strong and consistent values to get to the point quickly. I would characterize those values as they pertain to Dead Cells thus:

Games should not aim to flatter the player.
Games should at least attempt to do something that is somehow unfamiliar.
Games should make the player feel something.

Here is his review of Dead Cells, in its entirety:

Sometimes your first impressions are wrong. I too found Dead Cells enthralling in the beginning. You stab and shoot and dodge and go: oh this. But the more I played, the less this mattered. What does this serve?
We still care too much about gamefeel. See Destiny. See also Celeste. There’s something icky about the way game critics fetishize it. That luscious feedback, that perfect extension of your will, that zone you wish to stay in forever. Gross.
I’m not here for your goodfeeling weapons. I’m here for enemies that fuck with my feelings. I’m here for encounters. But Dead Cells has no taste for that. Most of its enemies are locked to their tiny platforms, pacing like caged tigers, awaiting slaughter. It’s all discrete and exploitable. There’s no real dynamism. That precious this becomes rote. Nothing accumulates.
Except your cells, of course. Because Dead Cells never wants you to leave empty-handed. The metagame is all reassuring progress and new toys. It’s a people-pleaser wrapped in a hardcore skin. It’s roguelike comfort food, which goes against the whole point of randomness and permanent death. I don’t even care about getting good. I’m here for chance and uncertainty. I’m here to feel our contingency. And this game feeling, this, is not here.

In response to this, I’m trying to reconcile my having played about a hundred hours of Dead Cells with my fundamental agreement with both Thompson’s general ethos and his specific criticisms of Dead Cells, without resorting to “taste is subjective,” which is true but facile.
I’m thinking about Thompson’s emphasis on contingency in his most recent (final?) writing on videogames. There’s no question that for a roguelike, Dead Cells is remarkably short on contingency. The optimal way to play it, if you’re not some kind of Hardcore Gamer with super reflexes, is to take full advantage of the discreteness and exploitability of its level and enemy design. Scope out the pacing enemies, wait for the right moment, make a plan, kill them before they have a chance to react. There are cases where this doesn’t work, but most of my mistakes in Dead Cells feel like failing to execute on a plan, rather than being forced into a situation where I have to think on my feet.
The most dynamic and exciting moments of Dead Cells are the ones where it forces you out of careful, deliberate play and into things that would be foolhardy if they weren’t your only option. I’m thinking of the harmless-looking training dummies that generate shields on the enemies around them, so that you have to make your way through the shielded enemies in order to get to them. A projectile coming from off-screen that you dodge by rolling into a melee. These are the situations that feel a little outside of your control, sometimes a little improvisational in how you have to deal with them. But they can also feel frustrating rather than exciting because of how unforgiving the game is, and how stingy it becomes with its opportunities for healing. And even the training dummies can often be dealt with simply by luring enemies one at a time out of their shield radius. The safest, most effective choice is often the most boring one. I see why Thompson disdains Dead Cells while regarding Spelunky highly. Spelunky embraces contingency, and having your hand forced. Thompson’s one-line review of it includes the sentence: “Forces consequential choices on the fly.” Dead Cells seems reluctant to do this, expecting you instead to increasingly flawlessly take advantage of its enemies’ routines.
I’m thinking about the mainstream and even indie critics that Tevis Thompson takes to task for being unable or unwilling to see through the good gamefeel and people-pleasing of a game like Dead Cells to its ultimately conservative and conventional heart. Because it’s true: Dead Cells isn’t really doing anything new. And I don’t think Thompson is wrong to say that critics are shirking their duties in failing to acknowledge this and demand more from our games than a well-executed retread. But I still sympathize with those who crave comfort, and a feeling of progress and improvement, in a world that often seems short on all three.
I’m thinking about the phrase “everything is everything.” It’s the title of a Lauryn Hill song that I know mainly from other rappers referencing it. Weirdly, despite hearing it a few times, I never really thought about it too hard until I started trying to reconcile how much Dead Cells I’ve played with how much I agree with Thompson’s criticism of it. But now it keeps popping into my head: everything, right down to a fairly popular but ultimately inconsequential video game and the critical response to it, is everything: the capitalist nightmare we’re all living in, where we’re all just trying to survive in circumstances designed to siphon off all our energy for our interests and ambitions and convert it into “productivity” for the vampires that rule us; our need for comfort food of some kind or another after being wrung out by constant work and trauma and anxiety; the risk aversion of game developers in an industry notorious for overwork and burnout where one failure could mean the end of a studio.
Toward the end of his essay on Fortnite, Thompson admits: “I’m still the fool who yearns for radical change and then struggles to walk out the front door.” What a fucking mood, am I right? I don’t want Thompson to stop holding game critics to account for their conservatism and myopia. But also: I get it, kind of. I also yearn for radical change and then struggle to walk out the front door, and for the last few months, when that’s been the case, I played Dead Cells instead. I want to want to be provoked and challenged by the games I play, but at the (generally literal) end of the day, what I actually tend to want is to settle in to something comfortable.
I didn’t write this with a thesis in mind; I just wanted to really sit with a very incisive criticism of something I’ve been enjoying a lot recently. When I did so, I found that I didn’t really disagree with it at all. Did it make me enjoy Dead Cells less? Maybe a bit. It certainly made me think more about what I’m getting out of it, and to acknowledge that “roguelike comfort food” is basically it. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with wanting comfort food, but I also agree with Tevis Thompson that we should be demanding more than that. Many critics rate Dead Cells highly because it succeeds at the goals that it set out for itself. Thompson questions the goals themselves, and that’s why he’s my favorite game critic even though he trashed a game I’ve been playing the shit out of.

        Foraged &amp; Found CSA: Week 3
    
    
    Week 2 of the Foraged and Found Edibles CSA has come and gone. Let’s review. I remembered to take a picture this time.

  

Clockwise from the upper left: shiitake mushrooms, wild salad mix, spruce tips, truffle salt, dried lobster mushrooms, goose tongue.



Shiitake mushrooms
Good old shiitake mushrooms. Usually I get these dried and use them to umami up my vegetable stocks, so it was good to have some fresh ones, but they seemed pretty mild. I used about half in a fried rice and the other half in some beans, about which more later. Not much interesting to say about them; they’re available in pretty much any grocery store.


Wild salad mix
    Wild greens salad. 
This, on the other hand, was interesting. The newsletter claimed it contained

flowering miner’s lettuce, wood sorrel, oxeye daisy greens, beach spinach, wild watercress and mustard flowers,

which: sure! I’ve never heard of any of those things, but they’re definitely all… plants. We made a simple dressing and augmented these greens with some dried fruit and nuts. They made a decent salad, and also introduced a new dimension of flavor into my vocabulary. I’ve seen the word “gamey” used to refer to edible wild plants, but for me it seems applicable only to meat, so while others might call this salad “gamey,” I would call it “yardy.” The unique flavor reminded me of nothing so much as the smell of the trimmings when you mow a weedy lawn. It was not my favorite, but it was a good and different experience for a few meals’ worth of salads.


Goose tongue.
    White beans with toppings. 
This “salty sea grass” continued my three-week pesto streak. I made the mistake of using sunflower seeds in the pesto, and they completely drowned out whatever interesting flavor the goose tongue might have had. It was an OK pesto, but I really underestimated how overpowering sunflower seeds can be! By this point we were swimming in pesto. I prepared some white beans very simply by sautéeing some mirepoix with the aforementioned shiitake mushrooms while pressure cooking the beans to cookedness, and then finished the whole deal in the pan. I’m always surprised how good beans are with very little special treatment, and these served as an excellent base on which to dollop some pesto, cheese, this spicy Italian fermented pepper stuff I got from Trader Joe’s, or all three. Also some good balsamic to finish it off.


Sitka spruce tips.
    Spruce tip salt. 
These were probably the most interesting ingredient this week, so I wanted to get a lot of mileage out of them. I made three things: a syrup, an infused oil, and an infused salt. I haven’t tried the oil yet, and it and the syrup both came out kind of a dull, muddy green despite the vibrancy of the spruce tips themselves, but the salt (which I also haven’t used yet) ended up being very pretty. The flavor of the syrup, which I’ve had on a yogurt breakfast and in a couple Italian sodas, is strikingly citrus-y, a little floral, and completely absent of the pineyness I expected from the name. To be honest, I was a tad disappointed by this, as pine seems like it could be a very interesting flavor, but the actual flavor is pleasant enough and probably much easier to use. I also tried just popping one of these little suckers into my mouth. I can’t recommend it. The citrus notes were pretty overwhelmed by a bitterness and the unpleasant sensation of chewing on a tiny, soft pine tree.


Black Douglas Fir truffle salt.
I haven’t tried this yet since it will presumably keep a long time, but I was pleased to discover it doesn’t have the overpoweringly earthy and kind of sulfurous smell of the more conventional (non-Black Douglas Fir?) truffles I’ve been exposed to.


Dried lobster mushrooms
Haven’t tried these yet either, for the same reason, but I’m excited to find the right use for them.

        Foraged &amp; Found CSA: Week 2
    
    
    It’s the weekend after week 2 of the Foraged and Found Edibles CSA, so time to review what I made with the week’s haul. Since this was the second week it wasn’t quite as thrilling as the first, and I hadn’t yet decided to blog the proceedings, so I forgot to take a picture of the whole spread. I’ll correct this oversight in future installments.

Ramps
Boy were these inconvenient and gross to clean! The CSA newsletter alluded to this:

Don’t be intimidated by the dirt. Cleaning is easy once you snap off the root base; the outer membrane will simply slip off.

I definitely should have actually read this beforehand, as I did those two things in reverse order, but the experience still would have combined dirt with the sliminess of week-old green onions even had I done it correctly.
    
Anyway, once we got them cleaned off, we got some mileage out of these little guys. Some we sautéed with raisins and pine nuts and put over whipped ricotta on toast, using a recipe from Six Seasons (a book will probably appear pretty frequently in this blog series) that is pretty faithfully reproduced here.
A few others went into pesto, more on which shortly. The remainder we dumped into another creamy (but dairy-free) soup whose other main component was mushrooms.
All these things were tasty enough, but I’m not sure they made the differences between ramps and the humble green onion clear to me.


Wild Watercress
I think we used about a third of this in some compound butter from Six Seasons. The remainder became another pesto, which is turning out to be a wonderful dumping ground for green things I’m not sure what to do with, but which didn’t really let the flavor of the watercress shine like it did with the fennel fronds from last week. My approach to pesto is pretty unsubtle, and it may be that I need to choose the nuts more judiciously or lighten up on the other ingredients if the greens are less strongly flavored or distinctive than basil or fennel.


Saskatoon Jam
This came in a jar and we haven’t used it in any recipes, but it’s wonderful on bread! The newsletter said

we like to compare the flavor [of a fresh saskatoon] to a mix of black cherry, chocolate and almond

and while it’s a nice jam, for sure, I wouldn’t say those flavors all come through.


Japanese Knotweed
A weird bamboo-esque thing, unpretty to look at and slightly slimy when cut. It’s apparently highly invasive but was not very generously supplied in the CSA — we got only a few stalks. The newsletter compared it to rhubarb and celery, so I used a very easy strawberry-rhubarb crumb bar recipe and made the obvious substitution. But there was so little of it that my using additional strawberries to make up the difference resulted in bars that basically tasted of strawberry. Which was fine, but I could have done that without having to mess with knotweed.
    


Brown Beech/Shimeji Mushroom
Appetizing clusters of little mushrooms. I forgot about them for a week and then dumped them in the soup with the ramps, which was fine but once again totally obscured any unique flavor they might have had.


All In All
Not a terribly successful week in terms of appreciating the uniqueness of these ingredients! I suppose, all things considered, the agrodolce ramps would be the winners as far as tasting good and letting the ingredient shine. Unfortunately even that meal was tainted somewhat by my being a dumbass and eating way too much bread. Will next week be better? Stay tuned!

            <content type="html">
    
        Foraged &amp; Found CSA: Week 1
    
    
    I signed up for a six-week CSACommunity Supported Agriculture, basically a delivery service for getting produce from a local farm. Typically a CSA will deliver to a local drop point for you to pick up, rather than straight to you.

 with Foraged and Found Edibles on something of a whim: it looked interesting and, based on a preview of the foods I’d be getting, like a fun cooking challenge to try to figure out how to use a bunch of stuff I’d rarely if ever cooked with or even eaten before. Then I decided, why not blog about the ingredients and what I made with them too. Week one went a little something like this:

  

Clockwise from the left: stinging nettles, maitake mushrooms, bronze fennel fronds, wild mushroom powder, wild ginger, fiddlehead ferns



Stinging Nettles
I was rather excited about these — they seem like sort of an entry-level Slightly Frightening Food ItemFor more examples of this category of food, none of which I have tried, see (with caution): huitlacoche, ortolan, casu marzu. I’d like to try huitlacoche sometime. The other two, not so much.

 which is intriguing to the culinarily adventurous. A vegetable that you can’t touch with your bare hands until after you boil it? Sign me up!
I decided to make a simple cream of nettle soup, as a way to get a relatively pure sense of what nettles actually taste like; this will be a pretty common recurring train of thought in these (hopefully) six posts.
Unfortunately, I didn’t love it. The nettles had a weird bitterness to them that made it difficult to tell how salty the soup was, and as a result I ended up oversalting it. Also it turns out I don’t care for the actual flavor of nettles enough for the “pure” treatment to work for me. I managed to make it through a couple bowls with the help of some plain saltines, but I wasn’t going to want to eat a half gallon of it.
Fortunately I am an enterprising reuser of leftovers, so half the remaining soup replaced the cream of mushroom in a chicken and rice casserole (based on the Joy of Cooking recipe), and the other half became the substrate for a chicken pot pie. Both results were considerably more enjoyable to eat than the soup, though also considerably more comfort-food-y. I guess the lesson was that I prefer nettles in lower concentrations: while they didn’t end up being particularly discernible in the pot pie, they did lend a nice complexity to the otherwise very boring casserole.


Maitake Mushrooms
I prepared this “hen of the woods” mushroom simply, using just the mushrooms part of this Bon Appetit recipe, and served it over polenta brought to a boil in the Instant Pot and then slow-cooked for a few hours. I used some of the liquid from blanching the nettles in the polenta, and also dumped a ton of pecorino, parmesan and black pepper in there for a slightly cacio e pepe-esque flavor.
The result was probably the most immediately crowd-pleasing of this week’s fresh offerings. The mushrooms turned out very nicely crispy, though they did crumble into smaller pieces more easily than I preferred and ended up without the incredibly appetizing, slightly caramelized look the one in the recipe’s photo has. The polenta was a nice pairing, nothing special but suitable as a vehicle. But the flavor of the mushrooms also wasn’t super unique: a little more “mushroom-y” than your standard cremini but not especially striking. Overall, a success, but not a difficult one to achieve.


Bronze Fennel Fronds
I’m gonna level with you: to me, these were indistinguishable from the fronds on “non-bronze” fennel I’d previously acquired from farmer’s markets and non-foraged CSAs. That said, thanks to the lovely guide in J. Kenji López-Alt’s instant classic The Food Lab, I now know you can make pesto out of just about any damn thing, and the pesto I made with these bronze fronds was a hit. If I found myself with extra fronds, bronze or non-, in the future, I’d probably try this version with anchovies because anchovies are incredible.


Wild Mushroom Powder
I haven’t used this yet, because it’s shelf stable and I’m on the “CSA treadmill” now so I need to prioritize the sometimes very perishable fresh produce that I signed up to have foisted upon me. If I use it in a later week I’ll mention it.


Wild Ginger
My primary concern with the wild ginger, which was appetizingly named but looked like a pile of roughage you’d get after weeding your garden, was to extract the flavor without having to chew on a root. I turned to one of my favorite methods for extracting flavor from things without having to think or work hard, and made a syrup out of itMy recipe for making syrup out of whatever: Cut the whatever into smallish pieces. Put it in a 1:1 mix of sugar and water to cover. Bring to a boil, then simmer forever or until you don’t want to anymore, topping up with water as necessary to prevent it from getting too thick.

. And it’s a good thing that I decided not to work hard on the syrup itself, because cleaning the dirt off these little bastards was a recipe’s worth of work in itself. I did so as well as I could and cut the roots into like quarter-inch pieces for the syrup.
Syrup is not really a dish per se, so I used it to make some granola: also an appropriate avenue for the shriveled little candied wild ginger bits I strained out from the finished syrup. The granola turned out very good, but I’m not sure how much of that was because of the syrup, which has a slightly earthy, very mild ginger flavor. All in all, a good result, but not one that particularly showcased the uniqueness of the ingredient. But I do have some syrup left.


Fiddlehead Ferns
The fiddlehead ferns were enticingly weird-looking but tied with wild ginger for the biggest nuisance of week 1: they were fairly festooned with motes of brown chaff that at least one recipe instructed me to wash away but that were embedded in the curly vegetables so deeply that neither a rinse nor a soak sufficed.
So that was a nuisance, and the flavor didn’t justify the effort for me. I pickled some of them and haven’t tried them yet — so stay tuned for week 2 — but the rest I just sautéed with butter and a bit of garlic and they were… fine. A bit like asparagus but kind of more bitter. I think they’d be worth trying in a recipe that calls for asparagus but by themselves they were nothing special.


Winners
I don’t want to call anything a “loser” because it’s likely I just didn’t use it correctly on my very first try. But the winners this week were, in no order:

Maitake mushrooms, though they weren’t especially unusual
Bronze fennel frond pesto, though it wasn’t especially different from normal fennel
Wild ginger granola, though it didn’t taste especially strongly of wild ginger

Lots of caveats, but I didn’t feel I made anything that was both extremely good and captured its signature ingredient’s uniqueness well. That’s what I’ll be striving for over these six weeks.

        2019 Retrospective
    
    
    After giving up on my pointless-feeling year-end music posts a few years ago, I wrote a more general retrospective last year and it turned out to be a worthwhile endeavor. So I’m gonna do it again. What’s the most interesting stuff that happened in my life in 2019?

About Faces
    
I gotta say the most significant event of my life in 2019, in terms of my personal sense of satisfaction and accomplishment, was releasing a full-length album that I wrote and recorded almost entirely on my own (with some phenomenal drumming from my brother on a couple tracks). About Faces was the result of several years’ worth of intermittent work and about twenty-five takes per track per fifteen seconds of audio. I listen to a lot of music and so I developed the common enthusiast/creator’s problem of having my musical taste develop a lot faster than my abilities. So it took me a very long time to be able to write any songs I thought were decent, but I like everything on here. There’s a lot of very true and personal stuff in the lyrics, but I also think the songs are good and even have a few interesting or novel musical ideas. It seems to have taken a lot out of me to finish it, and I haven’t really done much music since I did, but I think I will eventually recover. In the meantime, I’m really proud of About Faces.


Therapy
In my 2018 retrospective I mentioned that I wanted to start therapy in 2019. Well, I did. It went… okay. I think there was some value in carving out some time and space to think and talk about my emotions to an almost entirely non-judgmental audience. But it never really clicked for me; I didn’t look forward to my therapy sessions or ever really find them to be cathartic or especially effective relief for any distress I was feeling. I think perhaps it just wasn’t an especially good fit — my therapist didn’t do anything offensive or otherwise Bad but I didn’t especially like him and he wasn’t very good at drawing me out. It was a decent My First Therapy experience but if I try again in the future, I’d like to specifically look for someone who will dig a little deeper into my issues and give me more concrete tools than general-purpose mindfulness for when my emotions feel overpowering or unmanageable. In the meantime, I’m going to try to make myself do more regular journaling as a substitute for the neutral space for venting that therapy did give me.


Wearing Skirts
I remember thinking, over a decade ago, maybe in college, that I’d wear a skirt if it weren’t a whole thing. I liked the look of long skirts on women in a surprisingly-nonsexual-for-my-age way, a “that looks comfy but also elegant” kind of way. My (male) roommate occasionally wore a skirt and I thought it looked good on him too. But actually wearing one myself seemed too much like putting myself out there, like inviting people to make fun of me. It was basically unthinkable. In 2019, though, after thinking more about gender than in any previous year of my life, I did think about wearing a skirt again, and I realized: it was 2019! Lots had changed since college For example, this album cover by rapper Young Thug. For a long time, popular rap didn’t really seem to brook a lot of deviation from archetypal gender norms, correct me if I’m wrong please. At some point when I wasn’t paying attention, it seems that ambiguous gender presentation went somewhat mainstream.

, not least that if I choose to wear a skirt I can do so in the privacy of my own home, where no one can see or have opinions about it.
Once I had this idea, I had to buy a skirt. It was easy to justify in practical terms: the weather was getting colder, and what better to use as an additional layer on my legs?There may have been other answers to this question but I would not have cared to hear them.

 I ordered a big fleece skirt off Etsy, from France, and it took about six weeks to arrive.
I loved it immediately, and still do: it’s as warm and comfortable and elegant and dare I say pretty as I hoped, and probably the first time I have dared to think of myself as feeling “pretty.”It’s worth mentioning I have no illusions that I’m being particularly daring in referring to myself this way. Yet again, a rapper beat me to the punch, this time A$AP Rocky with his tendency to refer to himself as “pretty motherfucker.”

 I have worn it in the presence of other people — not counting my partner, who I knew with absolute certainty would never tease me about it — three times, and I remember them distinctly despite their being actually very uneventful. The first was in the presence of my mom and brother, but not my uncle and aunt, when I stayed with my mom around Thanksgiving. The second was on a brief walk with my partner around the neighborhood in the cold after dark. The most recent was at karaoke, with some people I met on a Facebook group for fans of the Achewood webcomic.An unofficial fourth time was in a Goodwill, where I bought two more skirts. I didn’t wear them in front of anyone, but I looked someone in the face and paid money for them. It was considerably more nerve-wracking than the karaoke, to be honest.

 My internal calculations before each of those ventures, regarding who would be likely to give me a hard time about this extremely mild tweaking of my gender presentation, really gave me a new appreciation for the bravery of queer and gender nonconforming people.
Perhaps the strangest thing about all this, though, comes when I try to think about what it, like, means. I went a long time without really questioning or messing with my gender presentation, and then in 2019 I spent a bunch of time on Mastodon, where a reasonable default assumption is that everyone is transgender, and those who aren’t are probably still queer. So it seems natural and even unavoidable to ask: what does it mean that I like wearing long skirts and how pretty they make me feel? Am I queer? Am I a cross-dresser? Am I actually a girl? So much of gender nonconformance seems to go along with other types of queerness that it’s hard not to feel like there’s some deeper truth to be gleaned about myself from my enjoying this small subversion. But I’ve thought about these questions enough to be quite sure the answer to all of them is no.“Cross-dresser” might be arguable, but I don’t feel interested in wearing any other types of women’s clothing, so it’s not an identity I’m comfortable claiming.

 I’m still just a straight man, just one who’s ambivalent enough about mainstream masculinity to tweak it a bit in the interest of feeling pretty and, let’s not forget, quite warm.


The Cat Situation
    
In 2018, we had a total cat turnover: we lost our two cats Fiona and Gandalf in the space of six months and went into 2019 with just one cat, Halloumi, a 9-month-old adolescent kitten we’d gotten near the end of 2018 to replace Fiona and keep Gandalf from being an only cat in what we didn’t yet know would turn out to be the last few months of his life. When Gandalf died, we were left with Halloumi as an only kitten, an even less tenable situation. So we started seeking out a new friend for Halloumi almost immediately, even as the throes of grief were still subsiding.

A Post-Gandalf World
Halloumi’d been easy to find and adopt. My partner went on a website for a nearby(ish) shelter and noticed he (then named Freddie) was impossibly cute. We visited the shelter and he was still there. When we went into the room where he was, he was sleeping; we woke him up, and he immediately climbed into my partner’s lap to purr loudly and soak up affection and generally make an incontrovertibly convincing case for himself as a good cat to adopt. The jury’s decision was unanimous. Halloumi was amazingly well-behaved in the almost hour-long car ride home, which we took to be a good sign.
    
Our efforts to find a companion for Halloumi in a post-Gandalf world went much less smoothly in comparison. We visited a total of five shelters — including the one where we found Halloumi — without being won over by anyone, and by the last one we were feeling pretty ragged. At the fifth shelter, we had to wait for over an hour to visit personally with the cats we’d come to see, and when we did so, none of them were particularly friendly or nice. But there was one more guy we noticed when we were scoping out the main area and when we visited with him, we realized he had thumbs! Franklin, as he was then called, was a polydactyl cat and, more importantly, turned out to be affable and inquisitive when we visited with him. We were worn out, not sure what shelters in the area we had left to visit, aware that any decision we made would be based on limited information, and generally vulnerable to a good-enough choice. Not sure if we were making a mistake, we took Franklin home; after our previous cats Einstein, Fiona and Gandalf (not in that order), we liked the continuity of having a pair of cats with H names, so as Freddie became Halloumi, Franklin became Hoisin. (Also I was and still am really into food names for cats.)
    
This story has a happy ending, but after we brought Hoisin home, he started having problems almost immediately. Shortly after his mandated cat-introduction one-room-quarantine time was over, we were playing with him and he started favoring his left forelimb. We took him to the vet and it turned out that a scab on his right leg that he’d had at the shelter was actually infected. So we had to return him to quarantine and put him in a cone and apply a damp poultice to his open wound twice a day to keep it from getting re-infected. Finally, in the midst of all this, and during one of Seattle’s biggest snowstorms in years — one of those ones that basically incapacitates the entire city for days — the re-quarantined, open-wound-sporting cat rather spontaneously vomited up a four inch long tapeworm, and no vets were open to do anything about it. A tapeworm is not a life-threatening concern, but it put us further on edge during an already stressful time. This was on top of the usual and expected juggle of having to entertain two cats who had already met each other and now desperately wanted to interact but couldn’t.
    
Aside from that it dragged on for a month that seemed much longer, there’s not much more to say about Hoisin’s convalescence and second quarantine: mercifully, he recovered without incident; even more mercifully, he and Halloumi got along immediately and swimmingly when that quarantine ended. I’m happy to report that our life is now basically a blissful stream of opportunities to take pictures like the one you see here.



Media and Such

Music
I still don’t listen to as much new music as in the heyday of my year-end top 10s, but I did still manage to find time for some stuff I liked a lot. In no order except alphabetically by artist, I’d say I had three big favorites.
I liked the power pop of Charly Bliss’s first album Guppy a lot, but 2019’s Young Enough really seemed like a leveling up. Eva Hendricks’s lyrics on Guppy were personal but often a little too oblique to get their hooks into me the way the music did so easily. Young Enough is less guarded and, despite the addition of synths that lay a sparkle over the often shockingly dark lyrics, more cohesive. It’s still as catchy as Guppy ever was, but it aims higher and hits the mark far more often than not. Its biggest stumble is also its least daring moment: “Camera” feels a bit underbaked and out of place, and even the minute-long “Fighting in the Dark” is riskier, more complete, and more successful. Everything else on here whips though. The title track in particular is a triumph.
Jamila Woods’s LEGACY! LEGACY! was relatively new for me: closer to soul and R&amp;B than anything I’ve really gotten into before, it took a little while to sink in. But I’m glad I didn’t let myself bounce off the unfamiliar (to me) melodic conventions, because this is an outstanding album. I mentioned it in my post about James Baldwin’s The Fire Next Time, which I read largely because of the track “BALDWIN”: one of the many glorious things about LEGACY! LEGACY! is the way it draws you into curiosity about the figures its 12 tracks pay tribute to. Its lyrics are by turns boastful (“GIOVANNI”), defiant (“SONIA”), and seething (“BASQUIAT”), and always thoughtful and empowering. But there are plenty of melodic hooks and delightful turns of phrase to keep you coming back enough to appreciate those allusions and themes.
The Mountain Goats’ “no guitars, no overdubs” Rhodes-keyboard heavy previous album Goths was decent but left me kind of cold, no pun intended, but I think that middlingly successful experiment paid off in their new In League With Dragons. The whole thing is at least pretty good, and the band is probably the lushest-sounding it’s ever been, but the highlights all come after the stark and kind of slight “Going Invisible 2.” In that song’s chorus, John Darnielle promises “I’m gonna burn it all down today” — whether he’s referring to the traditional Mountain Goats sound, to which the album up to that point has hewed fairly closely, is unclear — and what follows are four strange and shockingly successful genre exercises. “Waylon Jennings Live!” and “An Antidote for Strychnine” are my two favorite songs on the album despite sounding almost nothing like earlier Mountain Goats.
A handful of other 2019 albums I really enjoyed: Brittany Howard’s Jaime, Buke and Gase’s Scholars, Carly Rae Jepsen’s Dedicated, Laura Stevenson’s The Big Freeze, and Mount Eerie and Julie Doiron’s Lost Wisdom, Pt. 2.


Other Stuff
In my last yearly retrospective I mentioned playing the extremely well-designed but amateurish-looking roguelike deck builder Dream Quest; in 2019 I played Slay the Spire, a more polished and professional game in the same exact genre. It was also excellent. I stopped playing pretty much right after I’d beaten the game with each of the three available characters, dipping only briefly into the “ascension” challenges; it’s impressive that the game, despite being very tough even without them, still has twenty increasingly difficult tiers of mastery to it, but I did not have the time or patience to dig into them.
I mostly trod waterIs this the past tense of “tread water?”

 in my TV watching in 2019 as well. I caught up on season 3 of The Good Place (the worst so far, but still very good), and the Steven Universe finale and movie (generally up to the show’s high standards but wrapped up a bit too tidily), but I think the star of the year was the second half of She-Ra and the Princesses of Power’s fourth season. It felt like a game changer in the same way “Mirror Gem” / “Ocean Gem” did for Steven Universe, and I’m excited to see where the show goes from here.
My most interesting reading in 2019 is chronicled in my Seattle Public Library Book Bingo posts:

Hybrid Child
The Beatrix Gates
My Age of Anxiety
Sisters
No One Will See Me Cry
The Fire Next Time

Finally, 2019 is the year I started listening to those good good boys the McElroy brothers and their family of fine podcast products (My Brother, My Brother and Me and The Adventure Zone, so far), via the time honored tradition of having my friend play an episode of MBMBaM during a car ride. I’ve since listened to the first three arcs of TAZ and about a hundred fifty eps of MBMBaM, which has become my go-to tool for cheering up and/or getting out of my own head.



OK I’m Done
Last year I concluded with “Here’s to 2019 not being a total shitshow.” Now we’re already 3 months into 2020, and like: who am I kidding? Non-shitshows are clearly just not on the table anymore. But here’s to me writing a 2020 retrospective before March of 2021.

        SPL Book Bingo Book 6: The Fire Next Time
    
    
      
This is the sixth in my series of posts about books I read for Seattle Public Library’s 2019 Book Bingo, which ended on September 3rd; I did get a bingo, but neglected to submit the card before the deadline. Whoops! Anyway, for the “by an author of color” square, I read The Fire Next Time, by James Baldwin.
I was inspired to read this book by the track “BALDWIN” off Jamila Woods’s excellent album LEGACY! LEGACY! and the episode of the Song Exploder podcast where she explained how she wrote it. Woods had an interview with Pitchfork which echoed much of her explanation in the Song Exploder ep:

He talks about white people, and how they don’t always see us as human—but he’s saying, These innocent people, we have to accept them with love. The way Baldwin talks about love is so complex, and it’s always an active choice, but that was always the part of the letter where I was like, Really? It seems very difficult to accept all of these people with love. Accept Dante Servin and [George] Zimmerman with love? That’s a lot, James.

The book The Fire Next Time consists of a pair of letters, “My Dungeon Shook: Letter to My Nephew on the One Hundredth Anniversary of the Emancipation” and “Down At The Cross: Letter from a Region in My Mind.” A version of the former, which differs a bit from the one in The Fire Next Time, can be read at the Progressive.
If I had a hard time writing about No One Will See Me Cry or Hybrid Child because they were kind of oblique and non-linear, I had no such problem with The Fire Next Time. Baldwin’s prose is elegant and straightforward, simultaneously merciless in his clear-eyed indictment of white America and merciful in his ultimate refusal to let that indictment become fuel for hatred. This book is challenging to write about in a different way: if there are hidden or subtle meanings to be teased out here, I — as a white man conversant with but not steeped in American racial inequality — am not the best person to do so. So this will be more a personal reaction to what I read than an analysis of it.
That disclaimer in mind, something that struck me about The Fire Next Time was how extremely (and refreshingly) not written for a white audience it seemed to be. White mistreatment of black people is axiomatic; Baldwin doesn’t cite statistics or relate anecdotes in an attempt to convince anyone of what he knows to be true. By giving up that defensiveness, he’s able to cover a lot of ground in these hundred or so pages, about the consequences of American racism and what it will take to change it.
The first letter, “My Dungeon Shook,” which occupies only about ten percent of the book, is explicitly addressed to Baldwin’s nephew. Despite that, it does serve a sort of introductory role for white readers like myself: This is how it is for us as black people in America; I’m trying to save my nephew’s life, so don’t expect me to sugar-coat it. It’s a bracing and uncomfortable read; ultimately, as well, a hopeful one, but not in a way that will let white readers off the hook. Baldwin doesn’t offer easy solutions or the glib slate-cleaning that many white people seem to hope for. His promise to his nephew is that

we with love shall force our brothers to see themselves as they are, to cease fleeing from reality and begin to change it,

and he must have known, over 50 years ago, what we see now: that this would be an arduous process and white people would by and large be dragged into reality only kicking and screamingTangentially related, here in 2019 is Michael Twitty responding eloquently to some of that kicking and screaming.

.
“Down at the Cross,” which occupies the vast majority of the book, likewise makes very few concessions to any imagined white reader. Again Baldwin is able to write with great candor about his experience, his knowledge about the treatment of black people in general at the hands of whites, and about the Nation of Islam movement that that treatment gave rise to. When he spells out the prophesy of the white man’s inevitable doom that gives the prophet Elijah Muhammad and his Nation of Islam followers their hope, their influence and their power, we sense that Baldwin is tempted by it. When his retelling of that prophesy culminates in their conclusion that “the sword they have used so long against others can now, without mercy, be used against them,” we sense his hand half-reaching for the hilt. And after he steps back from that tale into his own life — where he once fled a different church, in part, because of a similar bloody-minded division of the world into us, the saved, and them, the damned — the rest of his meeting with Elijah and his subsequent trip across the city to meet with some white friends feels like a kind of long exhalation of a breath caught in acknowledgement of the power of Elijah’s story.
When Baldwin is spinning on the impossibility of convincing Elijah that white people don’t, perhaps, deserve wholesale annihilation, he feels a moment of kinship with the conscious white people he’s come to know:

In the eeriest way possible, I suddenly had a glimpse of what white people must go through at a dinner table when they are trying to prove that Negroes are not subhuman. I had almost said, after all, “Well, take my friend Mary,” and very nearly descended to a catalogue of those virtues that gave Mary the right to be alive.

It’s characteristic of the charity and compassion Baldwin displays throughout The Fire Next Time, of his empathy and his refusal to let the long and bloody history of white people’s aggression entirely cloud his view of their humanity. One wishes that white people were generally better at reciprocating that empathy; making this book required reading in high school would be a good step along that path, but failing that, it’s never too late to start. I can’t think of a person to whom I wouldn’t recommend this book.

        SPL Book Bingo Book 5: No One Will See Me Cry
    
    
      
This is the fifth in my series of posts about books I read for Seattle Public Library’s 2019 Book Bingo. For the “by an author from Mexico or Canada” square, I read No One Will See Me Cry, by Cristina Rivera-Garza, translated to English by Andrew Hurley. Straight up: I had a tough time with this book, and I might have a tough time writing about it. But I’ll see what I can do.
Where to begin with this book? It’s yet another fragmentary, disjointed narrative of the kind I’ve been subjecting myself to a lot these days: it leaps backwards and forwards in time and probably 70% of it is taken up with one or another character telling stories from deep in their past. In the book’s present of 1920, not much happens: a morphine-addicted photographer, Joaquín Buitrago, sees a woman, Matilda Burgos, in an insane asylum that has employed him to photograph the inmates. He realizes that he had photographed her in a bordello back when she was a prostitute and he was in the habit of photographing prostitutes, and becomes obsessed with finding out her story. With some help from the apparently indifferently scrupulous doctor, Eduardo Oligochea, who admitted Matilda, he gains access to Matilda’s history first through her file and eventually through her own telling. They leave the asylum together under unclear circumstances and move into a house together. Joaquín enlists Eduardo’s help again to collect an inheritance dependent on his being free of his morphine addiction, which he is not, in the hopes of being able to support himself and Matilda indefinitely. Matilda leaves him anyway.
More than any other book I’ve read for Book Bingo, thinking about No One Will See Me Cry feels like stretching my brain, like there’s a muscle in my head that I threaten to pull by reaching for threads in this story and trying to pull them together into something cohesive. But after pondering it for a while, if I had to name the central theme of No One Will See Me Cry, it’s the way that modernization and colonialism — what Dr. Oligochea calls “reason” at the book’s most chilling twist — sweep those not willing or able to fall in line into madness, penury or death at the fringes of “civilized” society.
Characters and events allude to the price of progress everywhere in this novel. Matilda Burgos reminisces about vanilla, which her father farmed before his descent into alcoholism:

But once you take it away from the trees, vanilla turns bitter, did you know that? Now the flower is no longer in the hands of Indians, but under the very watchful eyes of processors and politicians. Those men, they’re white, mestizos, Europeans. … They are men of violence.

An insane asylum inmate, morphine-addicted, says to Eduardo Oligochea, avatar of modernity, precision, exactitude, as the doctor constructs profiles of his patients:

I was saying that I do not believe in the boredom of the future, that [morphine] is the only thing that can save me from the absurd dreams of generals and presidents. I was saying that people like you, doctor, are going to drive this country straight to ruin.

A successful attorney looks on prodigal son Joaquín and muses fatuously:

Disenchantment, disillusionment is in vogue these days. Touching upon it is an index of intelligence, the mark of a refined spirit. Without it, the others would not be able to justify progress. Their own. Among certain successful men, losers are beautiful beings, not to mention essential in the complex interactions of modern life.

Joaquín seems to be the main character of the story, but his role is mostly that of historian, chronicler, archivist, suitable to his profession as a photographer. Several pictures handled throughout the course of the novel bear his initials. But his own history is interesting mostly insofar as it intersects with that of Matilda, the object of his fascination.
Matilda’s story, when we finally get to it, feels like the real kernel of the novel, despite that we’re given many superficial reasons to doubt it: after her monologue about her father the vanilla farmer, Matilda says “But I’m crazy, Joaquín, so don’t pay me any mind. Don’t believe a word of this.” Dr. Oligochea says of her in his psychiatric report, “She suffers from an eccentric imagination and has a clear tendency to invent stories,” and says to Joaquín, “Don’t tell me you believe her stories are true.” But Joaquín does believe her; through his belief, we have little choice but to do so too.
I suspect I’d have had more success understanding this story if I’d known more about Mexican history going in. But still: I looked up the event in Río Blanco in January, 1907 that is alluded to in a few places, including what’s arguably the tragic climax of the main plotline, but never explained. It was a workers’ riot stemming from a strike. The novel’s most mythic figure, the pianist Diamantina Vicario who captivates both Joaquín and Matilda in turn, is a devotee of “the Cause” of revolution, socialism. And though the turmoil in Mexico in the early 20th century happens mostly in the background of the events of No One Will See Me Cry, it still seems to steer Joaquín and especially Matilda toward tragedy, marginalization and hardship at every turn. One doesn’t need to know the details to get the sense of being ground beneath the wheels of progress.
Besides the historical context, I wish I’d had more of a sense of the theme I mentioned above when I started this novel. Flipping through it again to make sense of it for this post has been more enjoyable with some idea of how it’s supposed to fit together; it has all the hallmarks of a story that’s less about what happens and more about what those events can be made to say.
Some of those hallmarks stand in opposition to a rousing story. There’s a dream-like logic to the events of No One Will See Me Cry, marked by inexplicable coincidences like the revolutionary Cástulo Rodriguez just kind of… showing up, bleeding, in Matilda Burgos’s room while she’s under the care of her rigidly hygenic uncle. There’s the unexplained lacuna when Joaquín takes Matilda away from the insane asylum: does he sneak her out? Does Dr. Oligochea give permission? There’s the dialogue, full of strange non sequiturs, turns of phrase, and self-contradictions. Matilda says on one page “Really, I don’t remember anything” and on the very next, “I remember everything, absolutely everything.” Other characters say things like “If you had been loved, Eduardo, you would know that it is never fortunate to be loved by a woman” and “All things are possible, Joaquín, except peace. Had you not noticed that?” The men have a collective obsession with “the first woman,” apparently roughly equivalent to “the one who got away.” Much of this either made no sense to me or seemed eye-rollingly melodramatic.
Despite all that, though, I think No One Will See Me Cry was a success for how it sparked my curiosity for the ambient history I never learned and some kind of deeper meaning to this strange and fractured story. I’d recommend it, but I do think I’d have enjoyed it more if I’d known what to look for when I started and I hope I’ve provided that if you decide to give it a try.

        SPL Book Bingo 4: Sisters
    
    
      
This is the fourth book in my series of posts about Seattle Public Library’s 2019 Book Bingo. For the “single-word title” square, I read Sisters, by Lily Tuck. This post will include significant spoilers.
Sisters was the first of two books that I read strategically in order to get a bingo with minimum effort, by choosing it from a table in my local library that had a selection of books tagged with bingo square categories. Conveniently, Sisters is also very short. Ordinarily I don’t favor short books, but for Book Bingo’s official duration (till September 3) I’m on a tight deadline.
Short though it may be, Sisters packs a lot of subtext into its 150 pages. It’s narrated by a second wife who is more or less constantly aware of herself as such, told as a fragmentary but loosely intertwined series of vignettes ranging in length from a few pages down to a single sentence. Those vignettes paint a picture of the main character that’s vivid in some ways and frustratingly hazy in others, though the haziness — and, for that matter, the frustration — seem to be by design.
Sisters’ nameless narrator is cagey, difficult for the reader to feel much real affection for. She gives the impression of being unreliable mainly by virtue of what she elides or otherwise obscures: she digresses into academic tangents, relates anecdotes but stops short of telling us why they matter or what they mean to her, and indulges in (seeming) non sequitur allusions to literature and historical events.
The most on-the-nose of these allusions, to someone at my level of well-read-ness“Moderately.”

, is tossed off at the beginning of the narrator’s recounting a dream.

I dreamed — not that I went back to Manderley — that I was in a big city like Calcutta or Bombay in India…

At this point, the narrator has demonstrated a preoccupation with her husband’s first wife that makes her affinity with the second Mrs. de Winter of Rebecca quite clear. But unlike Rebecca, whose malign influence that story’s narrator seems unable to escape, Sisters’s first wife seems just to be trying to mind her own business. The narrator’s obsession with her, whether amusing herself with Fermi questions about how many times “she”It doesn’t seem possible to discuss this book without mentioning the narrator’s consistent stylistic quirk of referring to the first wife as “she”, always in italics. I found the seething undercurrent lent by this to be somewhat at odds with the narrator’s actual tone when discussing the first wife, which generally fell somewhere between curiosity and mild intimidation, but given the narrator’s capacity for self-deception that dissonance could certainly have been intentional. It’s also notable that she is italicized only as the subject; the narrator never refers to her as “her.”

 and her ex-husband “fucked” or going out of her way to grocery shop in her neighborhood, hoping to run into her, seems entirely self-inflicted.
In an early apparent non sequitur, the narrator compares the first wife’s “Grecian nose” to that of Michaelangelo’s David and then somewhat incongruously tells us the precise height and weight of David, both of which are considerable. Revisiting the novel in order to write this post, I realized these trivia are a cheeky reference to the actual way the first wife looms over the narrator’s life and the gravity she exerts on the narrator’s thoughts. But it’s not clear whether the narrator herself is aware of this or whether she retreats into statistics as a distraction — and, if the latter, it’s also an open question whom she’s trying to distract.
I suspect there are many such instances of the narrator of Sisters revealing more than she intends in her dramatic changes of subject or her retreats into irrelevant details. The problem is that I don’t particularly care to find them, because I don’t particularly care about these characters.
The plot of Sisters, such as it is, hangs on the narrator’s relationship with the family she married into, with some spicy will-they-or-won’t-they-or-did-or-didn’t-they questions of infidelity to add a little intrigue. But the fill-in-the-blanks plot mainly serves to highlight the narrator’s preoccupations and insecurity. The few candid looks we get at her interactions with her husband don’t encourage us to view the marriage itself as particularly special or worth preserving, and the scenes where we see her with her stepchildren can mostly be characterized as “cordial.” And the narrator herself engages in so much diversion and throws up so many smokescreens that it’s hard to get enough of a handle on her to care very deeply about her.
The book’s title refers to the quote in its preamble, “First and second wives are like sisters.” There are ways in which its narrator relates to her husband’s first wife as one might a sister: as a rival, an intimidating presence, an object of envy and admiration. But she doesn’t seem to be able to find it in herself to relate to her as a person. In the wake of the divorce that concludes the book — which by that point comes as no great surprise — the narrator declares her intent to reach out to her once more, in a way that perhaps better acknowledges her humanity and may start to put them on more of an equal footing. One can hope that the title will be realized in a meaningful friendship as well. But we don’t get to see the outcome of this phone call, so it’s up to us to weigh the narrator’s capacity for self-deception against our own belief in her capacity for growth, and decide.

        SPL Book Bingo 3: My Age of Anxiety
    
    
      
This is the third book in my series of posts about Seattle Public Library’s 2019 Book Bingo. For the “book about disability” square, I read My Age of Anxiety, by Scott Stossel.
Is anxiety a “disability?” It’s impossible to read this book and come away thinking the answer is categorically “no.” The anxiety Stossel describes is all-consuming, incapacitating, reason-destroying. One of his stated goals in writing My Age of Anxiety was to better understand the nature of his affliction, and thereby better cope with it. On the evidence of what’s between the covers of the book, it didn’t work. In several places Stossel recounts feeling himself start to be consumed by anxiety and trying to fend it off with his knowledge of the underlying neurochemistry or the long history of fellow eminent sufferers of his condition, only to watch himself crumble under the sway of his hyperactive amygdala all the same.
Scott Stossel’s knowledge of anxiety that I alluded to in the last paragraph is considerable. Somewhat unusally for the kinds of books I usually read, My Age of Anxiety has 40 pages of citations and bibliography, and an index. Its scope is broad, spanning hundreds of years of historical perspectives on anxiety across multiple disciplines: psychology, neuroscience, sociology, philosophy and evolutionary biology, among others, all have their say. The only axes along which I noticed a pretty narrow focus were those of culture and geography: Stossel mentions a study here and there which compares anxiety between different populations, but for the most part the book focuses on the white Anglo-Saxon world, somewhat to its detriment. I would have liked more about how anxiety manifests and is studied and perceived in other cultures, and less minutiae about the various abstruse synaptic chemical reactions and particular genes that give rise to or inhibit anxiety. Stossel is an entertaining and good-humored writer, but he couldn’t totally keep this material from being dry in places. With scant background knowledge of or interest in neuroscience or genetics, I have little patience for passages such as “The first gene, known as COMT, is found on chromosome 22 and encodes the production of an enzyme (catechol-O-methyltransferase) that breaks down dopamine in the prefrontal cortex of the brain,” and this book is littered with such disconnected, jargon-heavy factoids that leave my brain the minute I finish reading them.
My Age of Anxiety can get pretty textbooky. But Stossel sprinkles it with personal context or anecdotes that often humanize the academic bits while also letting his personality and sense of humor shine through a little more. The anecdotes include several of what are, it must be assumed, some of his most dramatic encounters with anxiety and panic. They are vicariously mortifying and often excruciating even to read, and they lend a convincing sense of urgency to what must have been a pretty intense search for understanding.
I have quibbles about the weight given to different perspectives and topics in My Age of Anxiety. Besides the aforementioned eye-glazingly dense passages and scant acknowledgement of different cultures, mentioned above, I wanted less about Freud’s more archaic nonsense, less about genetics, and more about anxiety from a modern therapeutic or psychological perspective — more, in short, from Stossel’s current and former therapists Drs. W. and L. Both seem to take the optimistic view of neural plasticity and assert we can rewire our own brains even in adulthood and even without the drugs on which Stossel spills quite a lot of ink. Part of this, admittedly, is probably because my family has its own history of dysfunctionality that I don’t want to be genetically beholden to and am working to subvert. I crave that message of self-determination. But I also felt like the up-to-date psychological perspective on emotional regulation got short shrift.
That aside, I’d still recommend this book; it’s very readable and even sort of grimly hilarious at times, and chock full of information about anxiety throughout history and through lots of different lenses. Just be clear, going into it, that it’s mainly a historical treatment of the topic, not a survey of current thought. I think the book jacket is pretty clear on that, but it’s possible I got a little lost in my own hope for what I might be able to get out of it.

Addendum
I’m a big fan of erstwhile writer David Foster Wallace (RIP), who’s mentioned twice in My Age Of Anxiety, and Scott Stossel’s descriptions of the self-reflexive nature of social anxiety reminded me very strongly of DFW’s writings on the same or similar topics. Compare for example this passage from My Age of Anxiety:

The terrible irony of social phobia is that one of the things people suffering from it fear most is having their anxiety exposed — which is precisely what the symptoms of this anxiety serve to do. Social phobics worry that their interpersonal awkwardness or the physical manifestations of anxiety — their blushing and shaking and stammering and sweating — will somehow reveal them to be weak or incompetent. So they get nervous, and then they stammer or blush, which makes them more nervous, which makes them stammer or blush more, which propels them into a vicious cycle of increasing anxiety and deteriorating performance.

with this, DFW’s description of a character, David Cusk, with deathly anxiety about public sweating, from his posthumous The Pale King:

For there were, by this time, degrees and gradations of public sweating, from a light varnish all the way up to a shattering, uncontrollable, and totally visible and creepy sweat. The worst thing was that one degree could lead to the next if he worried about it too much, if he was too afraid that a slight sweat would get worse and tried too hard to control or avoid it. The fear of it could bring it on. He did not truly begin to suffer until he understood this fact, an understanding he came to slowly at first and then all of an awful sudden.

The comparisons between Stossel’s and DFW’s descriptions of anxiety don’t end there. Both Stossel (in describing his emetophobia, or fear of vomiting) and Cusk are aware of the absurdity of their phobia and totally uncomforted by that absurdity. That awareness of the absurdity also leads both Stossel and DFW to go to great lengths to convey the inner workings of a person experiencing an anxiety-induced panic attack, and the similarities between their descriptions are enough to make it pretty clear that it wasn’t the breadth of DFW’s imagination that enabled him to write about anxiety so vividly.

        SPL Book Bingo 2: The Beatrix Gates
    
    
      
This is the second in a series of posts about books I read for Seattle Public Library’s Book Bingo. For the “Challenges your world view” square, I read The Beatrix Gates, by Rachel Pollack.
Content warning: The Beatrix Gates is very heavy on issues of transgender identity. That’s not the content warning, hold your horses. The content warning is that I’m a cis man and I’m going to write about transgender issues in the process of discussing this book. I’m 100% supportive of the right of everyone to live as their chosen gender or to reject the gender binary entirely, so I’m not going to be coming in hot with some bigoted shit here, and I think my understanding of how to talk about gender stuff respectfully is reasonably solid. But I’m still cis and I haven’t lived it; I may slip up, and even if I don’t, probably any thoughts I have will be  101-level  and it’s best to consider my audience to be other cis people.
Technically the book I read is titled “The Beatrix Gates, Plus…” as it contains the title story and two others, as well as a nonfiction personal essay, Trans Central Station, and an interview with the author. But I want to talk about the title story first.
My main exposure to trans people has been on the social network Mastodon, which is a relatively accepting internet space and so attracted lots of folks who wanted to get away from all the Nazis that Twitter happily embraces telling them they ought to be holocausted or whatever Nazis like to say these days. The Beatrix Gates has a vibe that I’ve seen from some people on Mastodon and which I can only describe, approvingly, as “trans supremacy.”I know that, especially with all the aforementioned Nazis that seem to be around these days, “supremacy” is a loaded term. But I don’t think “trans supremacy” is a problem like white supremacy is, for basically the same reason that I don’t think “punching up” is a problem in comedy. In fact I think it’s a great thing for marginalized people not to settle for the scraps the majority is willing to throw to them, or for merely being regarded as human in the way that the majority takes for granted, but to recast the things they’re marginalized for as strengths and celebrate them.


The running theme of trans supremacy, which I should re-emphasize that I made up, is that trans people confront and seize control of their own biology— even if they don’t medically transition — in a way that cis people generally don’t even contemplate. I’ve generally been ambivalent about my gender — American masculinity has a whole lot of problems I don’t want to cozy up to — but still, while reading Mastodon recently, I was struck by the realization that at the age of 36 I’d never asked myself: am I actually a man? I’m pretty sure the answer is yes, but the point is how long it took me to ask. Trans people can’t live on gender autopilot in the way that I did for most of my life. They have to wrestle with the question of how to live authentically in the bodies they were born with, or change those bodies to better align with how they feel. I’ve seen trans people on Mastodon who seem to have struggled with that and, at least somewhat, overcome it, and it seems like that struggle made them more comfortable in their skin than most cis people I know.
In Trans Central Station, Rachel Pollack devotes a couple of pages to looking at how the meaning of the prefix “trans-” pertains to transgender experience in some other words in which it appears: transport, transparent, transmission, and so on. But one she leaves out, and which seems most relevant to The Beatrix Gates, is transcendence. The Beatrix Gates asks: if trans people are able to transcend their assigned gender, what else might they be able to transcend? It answers: how about mortality? This passage, which encapsulates my idea of trans supremacy as well as any I’ve seen, explains how this came to be:

The nons—the non-transsexuals… wanted their nan-o-ma-chines [sic] to make them better, to cure their sicknesses and keep them young, and make everyone pretty, but not different. They didn’t want to stop being who they were, or thought they were, to become seriously new.

That notion of embracing technology to become something new seems to draw a lot of trans people to cyberpunk, which although it’s usually dystopian is also incredibly rich with possibility for body modification. But The Beatrix Gates isn’t a cyberpunk story; instead, its central story of how its trans people achieved immortality takes up about half its length and is told as a sort of fairy tale or parable. This, along with a looser theme of mortality, seems to be the thread that unites Gates and the two other stories that make up this micro-compilation. The Woman Who Didn’t Come Back is fully framed as a myth explaining how women had and then lost a kind of immortality, or at least a second life. Burning Beard is a retelling of the Biblical story of Joseph, at the end of his life and remembering how his divine visions have shaped it. They’re fine enough stories but I didn’t get a lot out of them. As well, Pollack’s apparently longstanding expertise in shamanism and the Tarot which she discusses in Trans Central Station didn’t really have an impact on me; her somewhat brief and superficial treatment of it made me feel like there was background knowledge I needed to have in order to understand its import.
So I think the real draw here is Rachel Pollack’s thoughts about what it means to be transgender in The Beatrix Gates and Trans Central Station. She acknowledges the struggle to be recognized and accepted but presents being trans as much more than that struggle; she reflects on history but, through science fiction, gives us powerful visions of a future as well. This book is a quick read, and I’d recommend it to just about anyone, but particularly to cis people open to a different perspective on engaging with gender. I couldn’t find a way to fit it into the above, but I’ll leave you with this quote, which struck me the most as a cis person:

With the wrong language, one of strict categories and confinement, the world becomes a fake, a stage set whose actors don’t know they are in a play… Most people do not notice this becaue their own sense of self, of language, more or less fits the received version of existence. They still suffer, for in a world of strict and very limited categories they must constantly check themselves against the model of a “real man” or a “real woman.” The ones who reveal the fake are the ones who simply cannot make themselves fit.

        SPL Book Bingo Book 1: Hybrid Child
    
    
    This is the first in what will, I hope, be a series of at least 4 entries in this blog about books I read for Seattle Public Library’s Book Bingo.
    
Hybrid Child is by Mariko Ōhara and was originally written in Japanese; I read what I believe is the only English version, translated by Jodie Beck. I picked it up from the library before I noticed Book Bingo was happening, so I was about 150 pages in before I checked and found that the only spot I want to put it in is “Fiction.” That’s an easy one to fill so early, to be sure, but I read plenty of fiction; the point of this for me is to read some things in less familiar categories. So this will hopefully help push me in that direction.
For being in an “easy” category for me, though, this was not a particularly easy book to read. Its disjointed and difficult-to-follow narrative has a lot of very sensuously described gore, violence, and decay as well as an even-more-unpleasant-than-average rape scene and pervasive underlying themes of corporeality and mommy issues (a term that I don’t use lightly).
The main character and titular hybrid child Sample B #3, we learn relatively early on, is an effectively immortal nuclear fusion-powered escaped military weapon who, by consuming part of a living or dead organism, can absorb that organism’s memories and also change shape to mimic it. In the first of the book’s two shorter early sections, Sample B #3 takes a nibble off the corpse of Jonah, a girl who was starved to death and uploaded into a household computer by her insane novelist mother, whilst trying to evade the military unit trying to recapture it. In the second section, again trying to evade the military, Sample B #3 takes a couple-hundred-year vacation into space. When we meet her again, she’s spent so much time “as” Jonah that she’s effectively become Jonah and is referred to as such for the remaining three-quarters of the book.
From that point on, Hybrid Child reads like its plot is mostly there as a framework, and the imaginative characters seem bound together more by thematic material than by an actual coherent event-driven narrative. There’s some kind of interstellar war between humans and a race of machines called the Adiaptron, but the main events of the story take place on a planet called Caritas far from the front lines and none of the main characters seem terribly interested in the outcome… aside from the intermittently nearly-incorporeal ultimate strategist admiral guy who is born an 800-year-old manYes, the birth is described in gruesome, harrowing detail.

 destined to lead humanity to victory in the aforementioned war and lives his life backwards in time, though really this all seems contrived mainly so that he can meet his mother and tell her in advance that she’s going to give birth to him. Just a heads up! There’s Shiverer Mouse, a poor fellow with a degenerative neural disorder who becomes Jonah’s first friend on her return from space and who lives in an ambulatory coffin provided for him by Caritas’s caretaker AI, Milagros, before she started malfunctioning and killing all the inhabitants she used to care for. And there’s his friend Lesiah, a member of a very ambiguously described churchNeon Genesis Evangelion recently landed on Netflix so everyone is talking about it, and Hybrid Child’s superficial and largely aesthetic treatment of vaguely Western-seeming religious material pinged my memories of watching NGE back in college pretty hard.

 whose principal deity might be the same entity that lends that 800-year-old military strategist’s life some kind of meaning besides war when he glimpses her in a sort of waking dream.
As with — and probably partly because of — the plot that never really comes together, the preponderance of themes and motifs that seem like the real point of the book never quite gelled into a solid takeaway for me either. One thing is certain: this book has a very troubled relationship with maternity. It expresses that relationship via a convoluted series of events that fold back on each other recursively: Sample B #3, as Jonah, the girl who became her mother’s caretaker as a household AI after being starved to death at that mother’s hands, gives birth (via fission) to a “dragon cosmos,” the interstellar organism inside of which she spends all that time in space, and which then delivers her in turn back on Caritas. Later, Jonah destroys her dragon cosmos daughter/mother in a fit of rage and gorges herself on the corpseHer resulting transformation leads to a fair amount of really uncritically presented fatphobia.

; this seems to be the event that tips Milagros, the maternal caretaker of all Caritas, over the edge from erratic benevolence into homicidal neglect.
I can see the central cycle repeating itself in various forms here, but aside from admiring the clever way the author achieved this (and grimacing at much of how it’s described), it didn’t really resonate with me. And the ending, which resolves everything quite abruptly and in an emptily tidy way, didn’t do anything to illuminate what it’s all really about. A couple of other analyses that I read, one by Bogi Takács from a QUILTBAG+ perspective and one by Rachel Hill that takes a deeper and more traditionally literary look, do a much better job than I at teasing apart some of the novel’s themes, but still don’t really draw out an answer to what I guess is the main question I’m left with: what was I supposed to have learned from this?
Hill’s essay takes a somewhat half-hearted shot at answering this question in its last few paragraphs, but I found it unconvincing. The excerpt she cites as an example of the sort of moral of Hybrid Child reads like it was clipped from a new-age self-help book on its own:

Love was the power of abstraction. It inspired two beings to walk to the same beat and to move closer together. The effect of that power went beyond time, beyond each of their individual attributes, and beyond race or species—like a miracle.

but even in the context of the story it doesn’t fare much better. I suppose my experience may have been attenuated by my sort of reading much of the book through my fingers, but the relationships between the main characters never really seemed to fit that description. The most appropriate part is “like a miracle,” which accurately sums up the ending, but none of the redemption in that miraculous ending really feels earned by the book’s previous events.
All in all, I found Hybrid Child a frustrating read. Despite the disjointed narrative and bewilderingly unfamiliar setting, the plot hung together all right, and I was able to follow it on a surface level far more easily than I expected. But it was still too jumbled to be gripping; I needed more of an emotional experience or beautiful prose or something to really bring it together for me, and the repeated hammering on the same themes made for a fun kind of treasure hunt but didn’t ultimately resonate with me or coalesce into some kind of payoff. It’s undoubtedly a very creative and imaginative work of sci-fi, but the gratuitous material made it very tough to read in places and all the more unsatisfying when whatever larger message it was supposed to be in service of landed with such a thud.

        A Whale&#39;s Lantern Collaboration Process
    
    
    I recently participated in a collaboration set up on Mastodon by a mysterious entity known only as “A Whale’s Lantern” or “The Whale” for short, who paired me with a total stranger so that I could work with them to write and record a song fitting a Whale-selected theme. This was the fourth such collaboration, but my first. My partner was a drummer and songwriter named Esteban.
The theme of the collaboration was “Portraits,” which made both Esteban and me think about The Cure’s classic “Pictures of You.” But I was afraid that trying to use that song as inspiration would end up with our basically rewriting a worse version of it. I’d recently experienced some songwriting success by starting with a pretty personal kernel of an idea and seeing what it grew into, and so I wanted to take a similar tack here if possible. My biggest contribution to the song, ultimately, was the lyric I wrote, so this post is going to focus mostly on that and how it informed and was informed by our musical choices.
The “Portraits” theme made me think of some self-portraits my partner had done for coursework in an art school which was enough of a pressure cooker to border on abusive. They did not accurately depict the strain she was under at the time, and it made me start thinking about the other ways in which portraits can be lies. Around the same time, I rediscovered a Tweet by Nathan Fielder that fit these thoughts pretty well. It became the direct and obvious inspiration for the opening lyric, “I’m thrilled to be here / And all my friends just out of frame are thrilled too.”
In the meantime, Esteban and I were discussing the musical side of things. We agreed pretty early on that we wanted to try to use some unconventional time signatures. Esteban came up with the idea of a drum beat that’s ambiguously either 5/4 or 4/4 to symbolize the dissonance (no pun intended) between the singer’s façade and their actual emotional state. We decided the verses would be nominally in 4 but with that drumbeat and the bassline sounding like they were in 5 to lend it some instability. Then the chorus would be straightforwardly in 5 and reveal the singer’s true emotions.
The 5-vs-4 ambiguity in the verses meant that the verse would have to be grouped into 5 bars of 4 (so it could also be construed as 4 bars of 5) in order for things to line up, which helped to constrain and direct the actual phrasing of the lyrics. And Esteban had provided some chord progressions that he cooked up, so I found myself writing melodies within pretty strict parameters. I usually start songs with the melody, because I find it difficult to make one fit within the constraints of a predetermined harmonic setting, so this was difficult, and I don’t feel any of the melodies are among my best.
I wrote lyrics and guitar lines for a verse and a chorus and the transition between them seemed awkward and abrupt. To smooth it out a little, I thought of a pre-chorus with alternating measures of 4/4 and 5/4 with a simple repeating lyric to bring the tension in the verse to the forefront before kind of letting it all out in the chorus.
With one verse, pre-chorus and chorus more or less in the bag, I took a fairly long break to finally finish and release an album that had been in the making for many years. It was close enough to finished that it was getting in the way of my collaborating on the Whale’s Lantern project. That ate up a fair amount of time but I think it was worth it. When I finished it I was able to devote my full attention to the collaboration, which also now served as a good “rebound” project for me to keep my hand in the music making game and avoid resting on my laurels after releasing something big.
When I came back to the collab, though, I didn’t know where to go from the one verse that we had. I toyed with the idea of expanding on the situation in which our Nathan Fielder analogue from the first verse found himself, but I wasn’t really feeling it. So I went horizontally rather than vertically: instead of diving deeper into the material I already had, I went back to some almost completely different ideas that came up in my original brainstorming.
The first was the notion of a king sitting for a portrait. It had to take hours, and doesn’t a king have anything better to do? The whole thing just seems very contrived in a way that fits well with the overall concept of artifice in portraiture. In telling the story of our imagined king, I tried to add a couple layers of intrigue to justify the melodramatic sound in the chorus. I’m not sure I succeeded, but I think it hangs together alright.
The third and final verse I devoted to something more abstract. Sung from the perspective of a vase (who uncharacteristically does not try to hide that it’s a vase) being painted as part of a still life in a nonrepresentational style, it’s the most off-kilter and unstable-sounding of the three verses due to being in 3/4 over the ambiguous 4/4 vs. 5/4 drums mentioned earlier. I think this was conceptually fun, but again I’m not sure I pulled it off; I went the direction I did more because I thought it would be fun and cheeky than because I had a clear idea of what I was trying to say. The melody is the least coherent of the three verses because of how weirdly the overlapping time signatures caused it to interact with the harmonic material we already had, and the lyrics deviate somewhat from the original concept of a narrator desperately trying to hide something. If anything, the vase is more clear-eyed about its situation than either of the two humans in the preceding verses.
That said, I think “fun and cheeky” worked out OK. Since I didn’t have any ideas for a last chorus and we were running short on time, I ended the song very abruptly after a final on-the-nose pre-chorus which spells out what, if anything, the point of the song actually is. It’s not a terribly satisfying point, and the music echoes that by denying you the satisfaction of a cathartic chorus.
Calling the veracity of art into question is not a new idea. Since I took some of the inspiration for doing so in this song from the inimitable René Magritte, I decided I might as well nick the title from one of his artworks too. So the song (which since it only “exists” in digital form is not really a “song” as much as a series of electrical impulses on a hard drive, or whatever) is titled “Ceci n’est pas un chanson” in homage to Magritte’s “The Treachery of Images.

” Alternate title, I suppose: “The Treachery of Sounds.”

        2018 Retrospective
    
    
    I used to do year-end best music posts, but it started to feel a bit silly when most or all of my list every year was just stuff that could be found on any of the countless other lists put out earlier by people who had actual deadlines to hit. But I did find myself wanting to look back at 2018 when the year turned, so I widened my scope a little bit. Here are some of the most notable things that happened in my life in 2018.

Mastodon
In 2018 I finally deleted my Twitter account and created a Mastodon one. It was a little tough to cut the string, and I don’t have any IRL friends on Mastodon, but I still don’t miss Twitter at all. Mastodon is better for my blood pressure: it’s got fewer Nazis, better moderation to handle the ones who do show up, and just generally a more personal and chummy vibe. There’s still a fair amount of irreverent shitposting, but it’s mixed with a good dose of positivity and all-in-this-togetherness and people generally tend to value being considerate and kind to each other. I still waste a lot of time on it, like I did on Twitter, but the time wasted feels a lot healthier. And being surrounded by marginalized people, many of whom were pushed off other platforms or just quit in disgust, is pleasantly disorienting and enlightening.


Therapy
 I got really into Dar Williams in high school. After the intervening 20 increasingly irony-laden years, a lot of her stuff seems sort of painfully earnest, but it seems like that wheel is turning around a bit: authenticity unmarred by self-shame is “in” for 2019. 
I credit the Dar Williams song What Do You Hear In These Sounds with inoculating me, about 20 years ago, against the stigmatization of therapy. But it took a really long time for me to actually consider it for myself, and then a couple more very foot-draggy years for me to finally take even the very minor step, in mid-December, of seeing an actual therapist in person for a short consultation session. It went fine, I guess. I’m very guarded and don’t open up to people easily, so the twenty minute session was fairly impersonal and coldly intellectual in a way that I doubt was very indicative of what actual therapy is like. But it was a first step and I’m hoping to be able to continue that momentum by “shopping around” a bit and ultimately actually starting regular therapy in 2019.


Homeownership
I bought a house in June. Actually a condo, because I don’t want to be responsible for the upkeep on a whole house, I think single-family dwellings are a relic of the past in a city growing as fast as Seattle, and I probably couldn’t afford one even if I did want it. Writing a lot about this doesn’t particularly appeal to me so I’m not going to. Suffice to say the process was roughly one part exhilarating to three parts agonizing and stressful. I do think we had some snafus that led to worse-than-normal circumstances and the average ratio of good to bad is probably more like 1:1 in Seattle (and even better in places that aren’t growing so fast). I’m glad it’s over and that I don’t yet have buyer’s remorse after six months.


Calligraphy
    
I’ve always had a bit of a fascination with both fonts, scripts and handwriting. I spent a summer in high school improving my normal day-to-day handwriting, and higher education in math ensured that I had further daily practice since the abundance of symbols made computerized note-taking nearly impossible at speed. Then my last full-time job exposed me to a nice variety of the world’s languages, and the aesthetic pleasure of the diversity of the world’s scripts was what fascinated me the most. So late last year I finally took up calligraphy with a dip pen. My practice has sometimes been sporadic but I’ve stuck with it for a full year; the “culmination” of the year’s practice was a little set of tags for my Christmas gifts. It’s not too much, but it’s the first work I did intending it to be “presentation quality” and not just an address on a postcard or some bullshit phrases written purely for practice.
The Postman’s Knock has been a great resource for learning some different lettering styles. It’s the kind of website that offers so much for free that I’ll buy some stuff more as a way of thanks than because I really need it.


A Bike Crash
I crashed my bike about a week before Thanksgiving, under circumstances that still aren’t 100% clear to me. I’m pretty sure I took a turn a little too fast and since it was a fairly cold and very foggy morning, there was a patina of frost on the trail or something that caused me to just go over sideways. The fun thing is that I don’t really remember. I’m pretty sure the last thing I was doing before I found myself dazed on the ground with a bloody face was rounding a corner. But I apparently also called my partner four times in the immediate aftermath and left approximately the same message each time.
I had a mild concussion, according to the urgent care doctor, in addition to the obvious external injuries to my face. (It’s a very good thing I was wearing a helmet.) This was the first time I’d ever had a concussion, and probably my worst bike mishap of all time. For fifteen years of cycling as my main mode of transport, I consider this to be not too bad. I hopped on my bike again as soon as I had a chance to get it into a shop for a safety check, which turned out to be about three weeks later, and while I’m taking corners a little more gingerly since then, it wasn’t a scary enough experience to put me off my chosen lifestyle.


Cat Losses
 I wrote a couple songs about and for Einstein. You can listen and download “The Eternally Incomprehensible Thing” and “God Does Not Play Dice” for free on my studio page. They’re also on Bandcamp if you would like to pay for them. 
We lost two cats in 2018, both to cancer. The first was Fiona, a sometimes-sweet, sometimes-ornery little female calico who we got not long after our last long-time cat Einstein died (also, as far as we know, from cancer) just three years ago.
We adopted Fiona at the very end of 2015, like, between Christmas and the new year. The cat shelters were all pretty cleaned out and we found her in a Petsmart, where she won us over by mooshing her forehead against our hands when we reached into her cage (an endearing tendency that she maintained for her whole time with us). We were looking for a low-key cat for our tiny apartment and she did fit that bill pretty well, though she was also much more interested in playing than anticipated and particularly skilled in the vertical dimension of the hunt. She was very hot-and-cold with her affection, alternating between curling up in inconspicuous locations to avoid any disturbance — which she would answer with swipes if necessary — and insistently demanding attention immediately. But she never completely lost her original charming love of a gentle hand to moosh her forehead against, at least until, shortly after we moved, she stopped eating and lost interest in just about everything.
    
Admittedly, I have led a pretty sheltered life. But nearly nothing in it has been as painful as having a sick cat with no appetite. The feeling of powerlessness as this small creature, who you love and who depends on you utterly, basically wastes away under your care is uniquely agonizing. And when it’s clear that trips to the vet are terrifying for the cat, and the only way to get them to eat is to force-feed them, my partner and I have fortunately been in agreement that euthanasia seems like the most merciful route. (I know that pet euthanasia can be a fraught issue and I have no judgment for people who choose otherwise, especially given the mind-boggling array of miserable circumstances in which pet owners can find themselves.)
So we had Fiona put down, when it was pretty clear to us that cancer had made her life a constant pain and being consious held no appeal to her anymore. It was still, and will always be, a difficult decision. We don’t know what’s in a cat’s head and they have no way of telling us, so all we can do is glean what we can from their behavior and tell ourselves the stories that comfort us most about the decision we have to make.
After all that, losing Fiona was like a dry run for Gandalf, almost exactly six months later. The circumstances were almost identical: complicating factors (in Fiona’s case, our move; in Gandalf’s, the arrival of a new cat) obscured the symptoms of a cancer that we didn’t get checked out until it took a turn for the worst, not that treating a cat’s cancer is really on the table for us. In both cases the diagnosis followed almost exactly the same route: after the distressing drastic behavioral change, blood and urine labs turned up something, and then an ultrasound revealed basically the worst-case scenario.
    
But whereas we’d only had Fiona for two and a half years, my partner had had Gandalf for over a decade, since he was two years old. He’d been in my life for the vast majority of that time as well. Unlike Fiona’s sometimes-fractious temperament, Gandalf loved to be around people; he was mild-mannered, so gentle with his claws that you could tussle with him without getting scratched, and daffily affectionate later in life with a purr that grew louder year by year and that we called his “pigeon purr” for its complex mix of percussive rumble and high-pitched pseudo-vocalizations. He was simultaneously easygoing and chock full of personality, quick to find any plastic bags left out (for impishly chewing on), new open cardboard boxes (for sitting in, a classic cat move), or clean laundry (also for sitting purposes). When we moved into our two-story condo, he quickly developed one method of ascending the stairs, from which he did not deviate for the remainder of his too-short life: galumphing all sixteen pounds of himself up them at maximum speed. He loved having his lopsided triangle face scratched so much that he learned how to grab your hand with his claws and pull it back to his face if you stopped before he was done.
Gandalf was the origin of the term “flavor bag,” where after we got a new bag of dry food and emptied it into a tote, we’d cut it open and lay it flat for him to spend fifteen minutes licking the flavor residue off the inside. His last flavor bag, which he enjoyed with as much gusto as we’d ever seen from him, was two weeks before he stopped eating entirely. I won’t belabor his abrupt decline, which was also shockingly similar to Fiona’s, except to say it was especially painful to see in a cat once so uniquely vibrant and friendly. The boy was one of a kind and we will miss him dearly.


Media and Things I Loved in 2018

Music
I loved Mount Eerie’s 2017 album A Crow Looked At Me enough to write a rare blog post about it. 2018 saw a follow-up and sequel of sorts, Now Only, and I loved it no less. If the first half of Crow was a transmission from the middle of an inferno of grief and the second half a sort of staggering away from it, Now Only is learning to live with the scars. It’s still a tough listen but less immediate and turmoil-wracked, more brain and less gut, with a wider view of things and song lengths and instrumentation to match. Taken together, ACLAM and Now Only stand as one of the more important musical works of the decade for me. It comforted me during my two terrible losses this year to know that Phil Elverum lived through something worse than what I was facing, to have him make gentle mockery of my impulse to isolate myself in my grief in Now Only’s title track:

I remember looking around the hospital waiting room,
full of people all absorbed in their own personal catastrophes,
all reading books like Being Mortal, all with that look in their eyes,
and I remember still feeling like “No,”
“No one can understand.”
“No, my devastation is unique.”

Anyway, to take a turn away from the tragic, Janelle Monáe’s Dirty Computer was unsurprisingly excellent. As someone initially drawn to the sprawling, eccentric and ambitious if imperfect out there-ness of her first two LPs, I wasn’t the best audience for her turn to a tighter, more focused pure pop album, but the mid-album run of “Screwed,” “Django Jane,” “Pynk” and “Make Me Feel” in particular is absolutely undeniable.
Of Montreal, one of Monáe’s collaborators back in the day, released a pretty focused pop album as well after losing me with their hard turn into shambolic kitchen-sink mayhem (and borderline musical blackface) following their masterpiece Hissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer? 2018’s White is Relic / Irrealis Mood might seem like another trial of patience, with its six tracks clocking in at over five minutes each, but think of them as six pairs of two shorter tracks which blend more or less seamlessly into each other: a bit more manageable. “Paranoiac Intervals / Body Dysmorphia” is the first single and the standout for me, a slice of perfect electropop that melts into something more abstract and unsettling, but “Writing the Circles / Orgone Tropics,” which follows it, is a nice slower comedown with some killer one-liners.
I got back into Future of the Left, the group of extremely loud British folks with the screamiest and most sardonic frontman since… well, his last group Mclusky, in a big way in 2017. Said frontman has his own project Christian Fitness, under which name he released an album called Nuance, The Musical in 2018. It’s a half hour of stuff just slightly too off-kilter (and sung or spoken in too low a register) to work as Future of the Left tracks, and it’s a blast from start to finish. The addition of strings in some of the tracks mix the sound up a bit without too drastically changing a game that never needed to be changed.
Finally, Jean Grae and Quelle Chris’s rap opus Everything’s Fine was Bandcamp’s number 1 album of 2018 and in my opinion the honor is well deserved.


Other Stuff
Dream Quest is a combination roguelike/deck builder/dungeon crawler with atrociously amateurish art (apparently created by the developer’s daughters, which is endearing) and game design so good that the developer was apparently hired by Blizzard solely because of it. It’s very difficult, but not to the point of being enraging. And it’s addictive, but not excessively so: I played it a lot for maybe a couple months and then put it down possibly forever when I felt I’d accomplished all I cared to. It’s definitely worth $3 on the App Store and almost certainly worth $10 on Steam if the App Store isn’t an option for you.
Continuing with video games, I loved CrossCode for its gameplay and, after about halfway through, its story. (The story is fine for the first half but became really compelling for me at that point.) It’s very well-made: the look and feel are so nice that the possible grindiness is enjoyable, and the puzzles in the dungeons consistently hit that “just hard enough to be satisfying to solve” sweet spot. I’ve heard complaints about the dialogue, in particular the ham-handed accents and verbosity, but it didn’t really bother me. Your mileage may vary, I suppose.
I think I read more in 2018 than in the last few years, but between deleting my Goodreads account and having gotten most of what I read from the library, most of it was pretty ephemeral and none of it sticks out in my memory as being astonishingly good (or bad). I did finally make my way through Ulysses, which I enjoyed intermittently but mostly just sort of swam in. Reading it with a guide helped, as I’d never have unlocked the more puzzle-boxy aspects of it on my own. Ultimately my favorite chapters (or “episodes” as I suppose they’re called) were:

Episode 11, “Sirens,” whose rhythmic and lyrical prose most rewarded reading without comprehension
Episode 15, “Eumaeus,” whose meeting of the two protagonists is rendered with surprising, understated gentleness
Episode 16, “Ithaca,” for the same reason and all those described in this cute Slate article

I don’t watch much TV, but I watched a little more this year than previously. Steven Universe continues to be, in my opinion, one of the best things going in any medium, even hamstrung as it is by Cartoon Network’s frankly self-sabotaging airing schedule, or lack thereof: its compassion, worldbuilding and characterization are just as strong as they were when I got into it originally. The Good Place was a surprise winner: live-action stuff is a tough sell for me because it can just be Too Much emotionally. But it’s been just consistently great, packing gobs of plot into each episode while consistently delivering great gags and interesting, well-acted characters. Just top-notch along every axis that I’m aware of. And the first seasons of Hilda and She-Ra and the Princesses of Power were also very solid, if not revelatory like my two favorites of the year.
Finally, I started listening to podcasts more consistently in 2018. My reliable weekly listen has been Daniel Ortberg’s Dear Prudence podcast — I’ve been a big fan of Daniel’s other projects for many years, and his advice-giving is no less a joy. In between, I’m listening to the whole backlog of Scott Aukerman and Adam Scott’s U Talkin’ U2 2 Me? and R U Talkin’ R.E.M. RE: Me?, half tributes to a couple bands that hold a lot of nostalgia for me and half just two pretty funny guys shooting the shit in a breezily amusing way.



Ideas
Between living with a partner who’s living outside the demands of capitalism as much as possible and sort of existing in/keeping an eye on some more radical spaces, I came across some ideas that seemed novel or made me think about things in a different way. This is necessarily a little vague, and some of these ideas are probably very Systemic Critique 101, but as someone that the current predominant systems have been pretty good to, I haven’t necessarily been pushed to think about these things as much as the places I got them from. None of them are sourced, unfortunately, aside from one quote I’ve seen that’s pertinent. They were sort of osmosed over time rather than picked up atomically from single sources.

Capitalism Isn’t Axiomatic

We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings.

Ursula K. LeGuin


What values arise from treating capitalism as a bedrock assumption in society? A couple have been on my mind this year. The first is the notion of “success” in capitalism. By most widely-accepted measures, to be successful necessarily includes having enough money to sustain yourself, and preferably more. But all this really means, assuming your money was earned with your labor and not inherited or gotten some other way, is that you have a skill that’s valuable under capitalism’s priorities. The thing is, if you look at how effective capitalism’s priorities have been in addressing, say, climate change, arguably the most pressing issue facing humanity in modern times, it’s clear that they’re not actually very well-ordered.
Other notions also seem less solid if you don’t accept capitalism’s priorities at face value, like that of “disability.” Some disabilities start to seem like dissonance with the structure of a society set up to satisfy capitalism’s demands, rather than inherent impediments to a fulfilling life. Indeed, the term “disorder” suggests this reading: not a deficiency as the term “disability” is often understood, but a difficulty fitting with the prevailing order. I think it’s possible to imagine a differently ordered society, for example, that doesn’t expect the majority of people to submit to strictly regimented schooling and then do more or less the same thing for 8 hours a day or more in order to continue to live, where “Attention Deficit Disorder” isn’t something that needs to be treated intensively.
Weirdly, the event that precipitated my thinking about this wasn’t reading the quote above, but seeing an episode of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic that my partner was watching. It centered around a competition between a small, pony family-owned cider business and the out-of-town hotshots trying to use automation to subsume or extinguish them. Despite that the show takes place in a wholly imagined animated universe whose inhabitants are all anthropomorphic quadrupeds, and where friendship is, literally, magic, they still seem to operate in some kind of capitalist system. I get that the show operates at least partially via analogue to the real world, but it’s still kind of weird that in a world where literally everything is made up, these magical ponies still have to worry about paying the bills (at least when it’s convenient for a plot arc). There’s still, apparently, an economic system in place that threatens a family with losing their farm if they can’t make enough profit. This doesn’t seem like it has to be a given.
(I don’t have a fully formed better alternative to capitalism. But I think we can move toward one incrementally.)


Personal Property Is Illusory
Speaking of the pony farm, when you get right down to it, the notion of owning things, or more nebulously, places, hardly seems like it should be a given. In fact, the only really solid reason that the things I consider to be “mine” continue to be so is because of the threat of violence by either myself or (more likely, let’s face it) the state.
This seems like a more fundamental state of affairs, admittedly. I have a somewhat naïve notion that even non-human animals defend their property rights to some extent, viz. a hunting animal defending its fresh kill against a scavenger. But the extent to which humans have taken property rights seems a lot more extreme. Humans hoard, sometimes wildly excessively (I’m thinking here of billionaires, not people whose houses are full of junk), in a way that seems plainly influenced by capitalism. Be it a competitive impulse, spurred on by that illusory notion of “success,” or a fear of finding oneself without necessary things and the valuable labor required to obtain them, the human acquisitive impulse doesn’t seem like a super healthy one. But what does a society look like when you don’t take personal property as a given? Obviously I’m not the first person to ask this. It’s just been on my mind a little more this year as I’ve been questioning things.


What’s My Motivation?

Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.

David Hume


The acquisitive impulse I mentioned in the last paragraph seems to be driven by two main emotions: shame (of being compared to one’s peers and found inferior) and fear (of losing everything and being unable to live). Maybe that’s not accurate, but bear with me. The point is that people engage in unhealthy behavior all the time. Sometimes it’s long-term unhealthy, because we don’t have a great grasp of long term consequences (helloooo, global warming). But sometimes we do things that feel shitty immediately or even as we’re doing them and don’t really know why. I do such things all the time, for sure. And I often don’t know why.
My question is: why the fuck not? Why isn’t the very basic skill of being able to assess your own motivations for your own actions (and thereby determine whether those motivations are healthy ones) a fundamental thing that’s taught in every school? As I mentioned much earlier in this post, I want to start therapy in 2019, and I hope to get better at this skill there. But why aren’t we taught the value of it, and some ways to do it, earlier? Per the David Hume quote above, why is our schooling all reason and no passions?
I mean, I think I know at least a couple reasons why. If I may be slightly glib, they are: patriarchy, which overvalues the “male-associated” virtue of reason and devalues the “female” realm of feelings and emotions; and capitalism, which assigns literal value to those areas commensurate with patriarchy’s priorities. This feeds into part of what people who talk about “toxic masculinity” are talking about, I’m pretty sure: the inability or refusal to acknowledge the emotional motivations for one’s actions (and, by extension, the legitimacy of other people’s feelings) because of our society-wide stigmatization of emotion leads to doing harmful things you insist are based on pure reason but are actually driven by emotions that you’re not even aware of. I know about this because it took me until about the age of 30 to start recovering from it. (See Therapy, above.)



Anyway That’s It
I don’t feel like trying to wrap this up in an elegant way. Here’s to 2019 not being a total shitshow.

        Spacemacs to Doom Migration
    
    
    I’ve been trying out Doom Emacs recently, because I guess I can’t go more than like 2 years without wanting to throw my current text editing situation out the window and replace it with a new one.
That current text editing situation is Spacemacs. It’s starting to feel kind of clunky, with too many moving parts to configure straightforwardly, slow to start up and slow to receive updates. Aside from those complaints, though, it’s honestly still pretty great: it’s Emacs so it has support for everything under the sun, the “configuration layer” system is actually a very nice way to organize functionality, and the “multi-tiered leader” keybinding paradigm is the best of any editor I’ve ever used, so much so that I’m not sure I could switch to another one at this point. That rather limits my options.
Doom is an Emacs configuration framework that, in the words of its creator,

strives to be fast, fabulous and hacker friendly. It is tailored for neckbeards with blue belts or better in command-line-fu, Elisp and git.

    Plus there’s this guy! Aww! 
I… guess I’m those things? I guess using this would be a good way to find out? I don’t know, “fast” just sounds really good right now. Anyway here’s a summary of what I found out in trying to switch from Spacemacs to Doom, in case someone finds it useful.

Should I bother?
First off, some subjective impressions from easing into Doom over a period of one or two weeks.
It does generally feel faster. Definitely much quicker to start up, though I think a lot of my long startup time with Spacemacs was loading my workspace with a lot of open Ruby buffers. On the other hand, loading a bunch of buffers shouldn’t take as long as it did (we’re talking a minute or more), and…
If something goes wrong in Spacemacs, it can be very hard to figure out why. There are a lot of moving parts all interacting with each other. Doom feels more manageable, but this may just be because I haven’t been using it long enough to accrete a lot of possibly hacky changes of my own.
Spacemacs looked pretty nice, for Emacs, but Doom does (subjectively) look even better. I haven’t felt the need to mess with the aesthetics as much, which is good because that was a source of considerable frustration with Spacemacs.
Spacemacs is definitely more “batteries included” than Doom, and a more comprehensively customized Emacs experience. The bindings are tweaked to be more “Vim-esque” in basically every mode Spacemacs provides through its clever “evilification” process, and language layers tend to have more functionality out of the box (e.g. auto-closing tags in Web mode). Still, there haven’t been too many things I find myself really missing in Doom, though I should say I’ve been mostly working with Ruby on Rails in it.
Doom’s developer is very accessible via a Discord chat. Spacemacs’s isn’t so much — it’s kind of been a victim of its own success in that way — but it has a bigger community. On the other hand, I’ve found Doom’s source a little easier to inspect to figure things out for myself. Ultimately, the amount of support available for each is a wash: I’ve felt the need to ask for help less with Doom, but there also seem to be fewer places to get it if I need it.


How do I set it up
Doom is in a bit of a state of flux right now, so I’m going to try to make these instructions future-proof: Go to the Doom github and follow the instructions in the README. If they work, great! If they don’t, it might be because the master branch is broken. Try switching to develop (using your blue belt in Git) and follow the instructions in that README. If that doesn’t work either, I guess someone probably opened an issue about it? Find that. It’s the work of one person so if you have a weird setup and it breaks and you don’t want to figure out why, Doom might just not be for you. It definitely wasn’t the first time I tried it, so I don’t mean that as a dig or anything! There will just be a certain amount of figuring things out yourself that will come with the territory, and switching might not really be worth that friction.


Where do I put my shit
What you know as “layers” in Spacemacs are, more or less, called “modules” in Doom. You’re going to be creating a private module. It will be located at either ~/.doom.d or config/doom if you’re doing the whole XDG base directory thing.
Unlike in Spacemacs where a private layer is just the “recommended” way of storing your configuration (you could, in many cases, have it all in your .spacemacs if you wanted), in Doom your configuration directory just is a private module. It has the following parts, each of which corresponds roughly to something you know and love from Spacemacs:

init.el - Every module has one, but for our basic purposes the one in your private module will be equivalent to the setq dotspacemacs-configuration-layers in your .spacemacs. Basically it’s one call to the doom! macro to declare the features that you want to use. I guess you can put other very early configuration in there but I haven’t yet seen a reason to do so.
packages.el - You might think this is like a Spacemacs layer’s packages.el, but no! It is a simple declarative list of packages using the package! macro that does little but add packages to be installed.
config.el - A combination of user-config in .spacemacs, config.el in your private layer, and packages.el in your private layer. I think. That’s a lot for one file but you can have other files starting with a + and load them manually, like (load +more) to load +more.el. Presumably this is to break up all the configuration that would otherwise be unceremoniously dumped in config.el.
autoload.el - Equivalent to funcs.el in your private layer. Or you can have an autoload directory and put multiple files’ worth of functions in it, just named whatever you want I guess.



Keybindings
The keybindings in Doom are both like and unlike those in Spacemacs. They have the same multi-level branching key sequence thing going on, and a lot of the top-level “categorizing” bindings are the same: w for windows, b for buffers, etc.
Unfortunately (for you and me as Spacemacs refugees) the bindings are also just different enough to trip you up. SPC b [ and SPC b ] go to the previous or next buffer instead of SPC b p and SPC b n. You open Magit’s status with SPC g g instead of SPC g s. Perhaps worst of all, “save what I’m working on now” is a buffer command under SPC b s instead of a file command at SPC f s.
Fortunately you’re probably acquainted with both Vim and Emacs so remapping keys is second nature to you. The Doom way to do it is to use the map! macro.
As of this writing, map! isn’t terribly well documented in Doom’s actual documentation, but it is in the code, so search for defmacro map! in the repo and read the comment. For supplementary material, refer to my example auxiliary config file, in which I’m depositing all my bindings transferred over from Spacemacs so all that muscle memory doesn’t go to waste. Feel free to copy it for yourself, and if you do, don’t forget to load it from your config.el!


Adding packages
Doom comes with a pretty good swath of functionality built in, but since you’re a Spacemacs user you’ll probably find some things you miss before too long. Here’s the basics of how you add a package to Doom, with linum-relative as an example:

Add (package! linum-relative) to your packages.el
Add a def-package! call to your config.el. This one turns on relative line numbers in all buffers and makes sure they use the new native line numbers in Emacs 26:

(def-package! linum-relative
  :config
  (setq linum-relative-backend &#39;display-line-numbers-mode)
  (linum-relative-global-mode))

Important and completely different from Spacemacs! Run make install in your ~/.emacs.d directory. This will actually install the new package.
Restart Emacs, or run the doom/reload command with SPC :. (Or use the key sequence SPC h R.)



Other resources
If you’re a Spacemacs user and thinking about trying Doom, I hope this helps you! Here are a couple other blog posts that could be helpful:

Finally, please feel free to check out my personal Doom config if you want a starting point. And here are some others that might provide inspiration:

the Doom developer’s, assuredly a better canonical example than mine of How To Do Things
Emiller88’s, a fairly simple example of a “literate” config which looks lovely in GitHub

        Bayesian In-toot-ition
    
    
    Someone in the Fediverse tootedThe Fediverse is, loosely speaking, a constellation of open source social media replacements, of which Mastodon, on which I have an account, is one. Yes, the analogue of “tweeting” is called “tooting” there.

 a probability problem:

A, B and C toot the truth with a probability of 1/3 and lie with a probability of 2/3.
A makes a toot and B toots an observation on whether or not A was tooting the truth or not. C toots that B confirmed A was truthful.
What is the actual probability that A’s toot was truthful?

If you’re into solving this kind of problem, please stop reading this post and work it out for yourself now. Subsequent paragraphs will discuss the solution in detail.

The Obvious Answer
My first guess, and the obvious “this is a trick question” answer, was ⅓, on the assumption that the only relevant information is in the first sentence. But I second guessed myself, because the question seemed naggingly similar to the infamous Monty Hall problem, where the “obvious” answer is also wrong, and quite counterintuitively so to most people including myself. I worked out the problem in a different way, and got a different answer. But the poster of the original toot asserted that the correct answer is ⅓: the information about B and C is all irrelevant, and the answer is given to you in the first paragraph.
Still, that feeling of similarity to the Monty Hall problem bothered me, and though my probability class is pretty far behind me now, I did dimly recall learning about something called Bayesian inference, which basically lets you update the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, “A told the truth”) as you get more information with the use of a pretty simple equation.


Bayes’d and Confused
Bayes’s Theorem isn’t generally stated this way, but I like the following statement of it: think of \(X\) as the event whose probability we’re trying to determine and \(E\) as the event that we consider to be evidence for (or against) it.
\[ P(X|E) = {P(E|X) \over P(E)} \cdot P(X) \]
Since \(P(X|E)\) is the probability that \(X\) occurred given that we’ve observed \(E\) and \(P(X)\) is the probability of \(P(X)\) happening in absence of any other information, this formulation is nice because you can think of that factor \(P(E|X) / P(E)\) as the effect that our observing \(E\) has on the likelihood that \(X\) occurred.
What does that factor mean, though? First off, it’s not a probability. If \(X\) makes \(E\) more likely, the numerator will be larger than the demoninator, so it won’t be less than 1 like a good probability should. But that framing also lets us think of it as a regular old ratio: since the numerator is “\(E\) given \(X\)” and the demoninator is “\(E\) alone,” the ratio is basically “how much more likely does \(X\) make \(E\)?” So the full theorem, using this formulation, can be stated as:

The conditional probability of some event \(X\), given some evidence \(E\), is equal to the unconditional probability of \(X\) times the effect of \(X\) on the probability of \(E\).

Given that \(E\) has already occurred, if we know that \(X\)’s occurring would have made it more likely, then we have more reason to believe \(X\) itself happened than in the absence of any information about \(E\) (and vice versa). That’s the intuition that Bayes’s theorem makes precise; regardless of whether the intuition is intuitive to you, the theorem is true, and I’m going to move on to applying it to the Toot Enigma and determining whether the answer actually is ⅓.


The Toot Enigma
Alright, so first off: there is, I suppose, a case to be made that by saying “actual probability,” the original tooter specifically meant “probability in the absense of any additional evidence,” in which case all the Bayes stuff is irrelevant and the answer is straightforwardly, indeed tautologically ⅓. But I think that interpretation of the problem is not only contrary to how probability problems are usually understood (if you’re trying to determine how likely something is, wouldn’t you always want to take into account all relevant evidence?), but also painfully boring. So, Bayes to the rescue.
Here, \(X\) is the event whose probability we’re trying to determine: “A told the truth.” \(E\) is the available evidence: “C said B confirmed A told the truth.” Since we’re told that \(E\) has occurred, we’re interested in finding \(P(X|E)\). We’re also given that \(P(X) = 1/3\). So to finish the calculation, we need \(P(E)\) and \(P(E|X)\).
I made a truth table for this, to take into account the eight (\(2^3\)) different combinations of truth or falsehood on the part of A, B and C. For each of these, “T” means “told the truth” and “F” means “lied.”










Case number
A
B
C
Interpretation




1
T
T
T
A tells the truth. B confirms it. C says B confirmed A.


2
T
T
F
A tells the truth. B confirms it. C lies that B didn’t confirm A.


3
T
F
T
A tells the truth. B says A lied. C says B says A lied.


4
T
F
F
A tells the truth. B says A lied. C lies that B confirmed A.


5
F
T
T
A lies. B says A lied. C says B didn’t confirm A.


6
F
T
F
A lies. B says A lied. C lies and says B confirmed A.


7
F
F
T
A lies. B lies that A told the truth. C says B confirmed A.


8
F
F
F
A lies. B lies that A told the truth. C lies that B didn’t confirm A.



First let’s find \(P(E)\). \(E\) is any case where C says B confirmed A: 1, 4, 6 and 7. The probabilities of those cases are:

1: TTT - \((1/3)^3 = 1/27\)
4: TFF - \((1/3)(2/3)^2 = 4/27\)
6: FTF - \((2/3)(1/3)(2/3) = 4/27\)
7: FFT - \((2/3)^2(1/3) = 4/27\)

with a sum of \(13/27\).
Next, \(P(E|X)\): the conditional probability that C says B confirmed A, given that A told the truth. This is easiest to calculate as \(P(E \cap X) / P(X)\): \(P(E \cap X)\), the probability that A tells the truth and C says B confirms A, is just the subset of the cases of \(P(E)\) where A also told the truth: 1 and 4. Those have a combined probability of \(5/27\). Finally, \(P(X) = 1/3\). So, \(P(E|X) = P(E \cap X) / P(X) = (5/27) / (1/3) = 5/9\).
Putting this all together in Bayes’s theorem:
\[P(X|E) = {P(E|X) \over P(E)} \cdot P(X) = { { 5 \over 9} \over {13 \over 27} } \cdot {1 \over 3 } = {5 \over 9} \cdot {27 \over 13} \cdot {1 \over 3} = { 5 \over 13 }\]
That’s a bit more than ⅓: the additional information about B and C actually did give us a little more confidence that A told the truth!


Conclusion
Probability is complicated and counterintuitive. Never trust your intuition unless you’ve got a theorem backing it up.


Epilogue: A Simpler Solution
We were looking for \(P(X|E)\). That doesn’t actually require a detour through Bayes’s theorem: we could have just used the definition of conditional probability, combined with the truth table above. \(P(X \cap E)\) and \(P(E \cap X)\) are the same, so:
\[P(X|E) = {P(X \cap E) \over P(E)} = { {5 \over 27 } \over {13 \over 27} } = {5 \over 13}\]
But I just thought this post was more fun with a detour through Bayes’s theorem, which is quite possibly the most important theorem in probability theory.
(Thanks to Ask MetaFilter for backing me up when I was doubting myself on this one. The discussion there is worth reading, especially this comment for a concise justification of why we need to take the information about B and C into account.)

        A Different Kind of Freedom February
    
    
    My employer Bonanza has an interesting employee benefit called “Freedom February,” where during that month every employee gets a week’s worth of free days off and some cash to offset the cost of using those days to take a tropical vacation should they desire to do so. Generally, several months in advance, employees decide on a few specific destinations and those who want to travel with their co-workers choose one from among them.
As a generally travel- and planning-averse person, I opted for the easiest destination, and then watched helplessly as it hemorrhaged people until there were too few to make it worth the while of anyone still nominally on board to plan. That scheme having fallen through, I resolved to use February to do some #adulting and take care of some imposing tasks that I otherwise foresaw myself putting off as long as possible.
The first of these was doing my taxes, probably earlier in the year than any time in the last decade. It was boring and this post will not mention it again.
The second was getting a vasectomy, which I had “wanted” to do ever since I found out it was a thing but been putting off pretty casually for probably about ten years and then more aggressively for another five once I got to a place in my life where it actually seemed like a viable option. Those last five years started when I got a mandatory pre-procedure consultation and then balked (and balked, and balked) purely because of the small-scale practical considerations.As opposed to uncertainty or doubt, which I never experienced in those fifteen years.


First among these considerations, from one perspective, was the doctor at that consultation telling me I wouldn’t be able to bike after the procedure for two to three weeks! Cycling is my primary way of getting around, and this seemed like just an insurmountably style-cramping restriction on my mobility: a big enough disruption to my normal life routine to require significant planning around it. But during Freedom February, pretty much everyone who didn’t zip off to a tropical paradise at least works from home for most or all of the month. So my excuse of having my commute borked was irrelevant.
With that excuse gone, though, I saw the looming procedure from a new perspective: one from which the previously insurmountable obstacle of negotiating transportation seemed utterly trivial next to the real and imminent prospect of having a complete stranger (1) focus their attention intensely on my scrotum for a half hour and also (2) cut it and certain of its contents with a knife. I have only recently become even mildly comfortable being seen naked, even in contexts like locker rooms where it’s 100% standard, so even the first part was going to take some getting used to, to say nothing of the second. But I knew if I gave myself too much time to get used to it, I would never get it done.
I guess that my ambivalence and anxiety about all this is not uncommon. Insofar as I have a purpose in writing this, it is to reassure any other bashful and anxiety-prone male-bodied people who are considering getting a vasectomy that while their anxiety about it isn’t exactly misplaced, it’s probably not as bad as they imagine or fear.
I decided to go to Planned Parenthood to have the procedure done, because I believe they do important work and I wanted any money that I (or my insurance) had to pay to go to them. Having done so, I recommend them wholeheartedly. Based on my experience, the whole process goes something like this:

The consultation
Either because it had been years since my last consultation about it, or because that consultation wasn’t with Planned Parenthood, I had to have another one. The consultation is sort of like easy mode for the actual procedure. There will be some rather frank discussion of your genitals and what will be happening to them: somewhat like a more intimate version of the reproduction part of your high school health class. If you are a prude like me it will be somewhat uncomfortable, but you’re not in high school anymore, thank God, and everyone will actually be a grown-up, which is good because they will also need to look at your penis. This will probably be near the end of the consultation and I guess it is to make sure there’s nothing going on down there that would complicate the procedure? I don’t know. Possibly due to my own mild neuroses, my theory is they’re making sure that you’re mentally prepared to drop trou when a doctor tells you to, because otherwise you’re probably gonna have some difficulty when the time for the actual vasectomy rolls around.
Speaking of which, if you finish the consultation and haven’t changed your mind, I recommend you schedule the procedure before you leave. This will keep you from putting it off for another several years and thus requiring another consultation later, ultimately reducing the number of strangers who have to look at your penis by one. These are the kind of optimizations that I, as a now-seasoned vasectomy expertPer 2015 statistics, I am in approximately the top 10% of “married or in-union” American men in for number of vasectomies achieved, which makes me an expert by any reasonable definition.

, can help you achieve.


Pre-Procedure Preparation
In the interval between your consultation and when you scheduled the actual vasectomy, you will definitely not think or feel any anxiety about it, so I’ll proceed directly to the day of the main event.
You will have to arrange some transportation. If you currently have a partner and they’re available and on board with your decision, look: I’m not the boss of them or you, but I think it would be very reasonable for them to be your chauffeur for the day.
At the consultation, you will have been told to shower. They might also have asked you to shave your scrotum. My above claim to be an expert does not apply here, but I can tell you that if you use a double-edge (or “safety”) razor on your face, you’re in for an interesting experience.If you normally use a straight razor, you’re probably in for an even more interesting one.

 Just remember: unless you do something absolutely catastrophic, any cuts you inflict on yourself will probably be shallower than the one you signed up for later today!


The procedure
Before the procedure starts, someone will talk you through the process. It will be more or less a rehash of what you were told in the consultation, I guess in case you forgot in the intervening time that you’re about to get your scrotum straight up cut open or that (equally importantly, in my opinion!) it will be anesthetized for the duration. At Planned Parenthood, they also offered me Xanax to help manage my anxiety. I was on the fence but ultimately accepted, partly because I had to admit I was pretty anxious but also to see if I would find out what Chance the Rapper was on about in Acid Rap.
Spoiler alert: I did not find out what Chance the Rapper was on about in Acid Rap. In fact the Xanax did not feel like it had much of an effect on my mental state at all. But considering how anxious I was about the procedure, the fact that I felt ❝pretty normal❞I’m trying to spread the convention of using these big quotes as dramatically overemphasized finger-flexion air quotes. Unfortunately they’re font-dependent and not as distinctive in this font as I’d prefer.

 during it probably means that actually, the drugs did what they were supposed to. (My dosage was also a lot lower than Chance’s, no doubt.)
I consider things to have really gotten started when I was given a heating pad and told to strip from the waist down. The heating pad was to wrap around my pertinent areas: I was told it would make things easier for the doctor if they were warm — the rest of the office was rather cold — this seemed intuitively reasonable, though I didn’t care to think too hard about it. But making things easier for the doctor did seem like an extraordinarily good idea.
After I’d made myself ❝comfortable,❞ the doctor came in. I guess we exchanged some pleasantries or something. He probably reiterated the process again to some extent. To be honest, mostly what I remember is the, like, scrotum bib that he put on me: basically one of those scratchy blue protective sheets like doctors and dentists use to prevent your various effluvia from getting on things, with a conveniently-sized hole in it. I remember involuntarily thinking about that stupid damn Dick in a Box SNL short and experiencing a complicated tangle of emotions at having it thus forcibly invoked and recontextualized.
With that in mind, let’s talk about that air-quotes ❝pretty normal❞ a few paragraphs up. You might think that what I mean by that is “pretty normal, considering” or “pretty normal, aside from” and while there were admittedly a few interjections from the doctor that would be unexpected in a typical polite conversationThe most notable and unlikely of these being a bright and chipper “Wanna see your vas?” While I understood the impulse — this is, after all, a once in a lifetime opportunity, one fervently hopes — my baseline level of adventurousness had been exhausted when I accepted the Xanax.

, overall we mostly small talked about our hobbies and things. In fact I was probably at least as comfortable as I usually am when I’m cornered into directionless small talk in any other setting. At the time this seemed completely unremarkable. In retrospect it seems like extremely strong evidence that the Xanax worked.
You will, perhaps, be curious about the pain level. I haven’t mentioned it yet because it was almost too mild to bear mentioning, but since it was a significant source of my own anxiety I’ll expand on that a little. I can’t speak to anyone else’s experience, but on at least one occasion the doctor said something like “You’ll feel a little pinch in 3… 2… 1…” and at the end of the countdown I felt nothing whatsoever. On other occasions I did feel some pain, sometimes without any warning, but not once was it worse than if I’d cut myself while shaving. Overall: extremely strong evidence that the local anesthetic also worked.


Recovery
I’d love to be able to tell you that when the anesthetic wore off it hurt like hell, and that I gritted my teeth and toughed it out, like a Man. In fact: no. And not “no, I failed to tough it out,” but “no, the pain was almost negligible.” When the anesthetic wore off I was, like, a little sore. I popped a couple acetaminophen the first night afterwards, and didn’t even feel the need to bother after that. Getting kicked in the balls in Tae Kwon Do, as a child, was worse. My partner probably suffers worse and longer-lasting pain every month from cramps. In fact, By quantifying my pain levels using an adapted version of the Schmidt sting pain index — they topped out at about a 1.2 — and comparing pain sources using some basic integral calculus, I proved that the most cumulative pain I experienced as a result of my vasectomy was collateral damage to adjacent areas when the my hair started growing back and got to that point where it was all spiky. (It’s now been about three weeks and it’s actually still at that point, though it’s finally tapering off.) That couple weeks’ worth of minor, intermittent discomfort adds up to more pain than I experienced during the actual vasectomy and subsequent recovery period.I did not actually do any of the math stuff. Nevertheless I stand by my conclusion.




In summary
If you have been thinking about getting a vasectomy but anxiety about awkwardness or pain has kept you from following through, I’m here to tell you it’s probably not nearly as bad as you imagine. And it’s the responsible thing to do if you don’t want kids, far easier than the equivalent procedure for your potentially childbearing partner and more reliable than lots of other kinds of birth control. Finally, if my experience is any indication, it may even make you more comfortable discussing and taking control of your sexual health, which I think is an important thing to be able to do!
That said, in a couple months I’m going to have to rub one out into a jar, bring it across town, and hand it to another human so they can check and make sure the vasectomy worked. While my experience with the vasectomy has given me the utmost confidence that the professionalism of the Planned Parenthood staff will make this minimally awkward, please do not expect a detailed follow-up blog post about that experience. Thanks for reading???

        Songwriting &#34;Process&#34;
    
    
    I’ve written, recorded and released into the wild about a dozen completely original songs, but I still don’t really have a process for writing them, or at least not a conscious one. This post is an attempt to figure out what works for me and what doesn’t. I’m not, by basically any conventional measure, a “successful” songwriter, nor do I pretend it’s anything other than a part time hobby for me. So don’t construe this as advice or think I imagine myself to be a model for other songwriters to emulate. I’m just thinking through what, if any, process I personally have, to try to have a little more control over it in the future.
I have a lot of half-formed lyrics sitting around in notebooks and a lot of snippets of music sitting around on my hard drive, or, more rarely, on sheet music. Some of these I like well enough, but very few of them ever end up becoming songs I like enough to finish, much less release.
On the other end of the spectrum, I’ve had a few song ideas just come to me—this is a total cop-out phrase, but bear with me—and then sort of unfold into entire songs very quickly and easily. A couple notable recent examples of this: “Where No One Has Gone Before,” whose intro verse melody sprang up more or less fully formed during a long bike rideI distinctly remember stopping at a park to record the melody into my phone. I’m self-conscious about recording in the best of conditions; doing so in public means I had what seemed like a guaranteed Eventual Actual Song. And I did!

, and “The Ice World,” where the first verse’s lyric just fell out of my emotional state at the time with melody attached. In both of these cases the rest of the lyric followed fairly quickly, and in a way that felt inevitable or at least very natural. Any other melodies in the song were pretty straightforward to derive from that first flash of inspiration as well.
“Inspiration” is, of course, the biggest cop-out word of them all. What the hell is “inspiration?” It seems un-analyzable: we imagine it as a bolt of lightning, powerful, random, impossible to command. I’m not going to try to lasso that lightning here, at least not yet. But some flashes of inspiration lead me to fully fleshed out songs, and others sputter out. What’s the difference?
The lyrical seeds that grow most easily into entire songs tend to combine an emotion or feeling with a metaphor or analogy robust enough to create a sort of feedback loop: the metaphor describes how I feel somehow, and other associated thoughts and emotions reinforce that metaphor by leading to a new perspective on it or introducing a second one that I can tie in. Then the additional detail or clarity on the metaphorical side leads to a deeper or more nuanced understanding of my real-life emotional state, and so on… and before long I’ve got a whole lyric written.
That’s kind of the large-scale conceptual framework that seems to be reliably fruitful for me. Harder to pin down is what makes an initial seed hooky enough to warrant expanding it into a whole song.
The only reliable technique I’ve discovered for evaluating “hookiness” is to refrain from recording or writing down a melody until I’ve figured out how to expand on it. If I forget it before then, it wasn’t a good enough hook. This is risky, but at the same time it seems to work well. I’m not necessarily trying to write earworms, but “enough to stick for a few days” seems like a good lower bound on catchiness. It also leaves the melody a little space to lead to another section of the song, before I pin it down and trap it under a chord progression. That tends to constrain the directions I can take it, which is essential after a certain point but not something I want to do prematurely.
Expanding fragments into actual songs needs to feel fairly intuitive to me. I don’t like to feel like I’m fighting with my songs, and it always seems like the results get worse the more I have to do so. If I have a verse and a chorus and can’t figure out how to tie the two together, it’s often a sign that the weakerHow do I determine what’s “weaker?” I kind of just have to trust my own judgment from being a music fan for about 20 years. Some red flags: lyrics that are too vague or use too many words to say too little, or that are metrically awkward; melodies that feel clichéd or obvious; too-contrived or (sometimes) too-basic chord progressions; things I don’t enjoy listening to myself; things I dread having to record in such a way that they sound good.

 one needs to go or be radically re-written so it fits better. Having a strong overarching concept helps here, as does having some kind of rhythmic or harmonic framework. Any of those things help constrain where I can go from what I have, which is desirable after I have enough seed material to sustain a whole song. At that point, anything that enables me to throw out bad options more easily makes the whole process less of a struggle. Though I don’t have much technical proficiency in any instrument, which immediately limits my options to “things I can actually play,” modern DAWs still provide a glut of sonic options that need to be pared back to avoid analysis paralysis.

        Wheel Turn 2
    
    
    
        or, the Mountain Goats&#39; &#34;Heel Turn 2&#34; Is Going To Get Me Killed, Or Save My Life
    
    
    
Get stomped like a snake
Lie down in the dirt

I have, mercifully, been doored only once in the approximately twelve years I’ve been cycling as my primary mode of transportation. If you are unaware, being “doored,” as a cyclist, means having a car door opened directly into your path of travel too suddenly to avoid it. I don’t know if all doorings are the same, but mine was a startling and wholly disorienting experience. I was cycling merrily along at probably somewhere between twelve and fifteen miles per hour, and then, before my brain even had a chance to process what had happened, I was horizontal in the middle of the street. I was lucky, in that I suffered no serious injuries from being knocked over, and luckier still, in that there was not a car just behind me to run me over and kill me instantly. But it only takes one dooring to make you aware of that possibility every time you ride down a bike lane idiotically placed immediately to the left of a stream of parked cars, any of which could at any time be populated by a person about to emerge and commit involuntary manslaughter in so doing.

Cling to my convictions even when I get hurt
Be an upstanding, well-loved man about town

I still use bike lanes, even ones that run alongside parked cars, despite the risk of being doored. I still operate under the regrettable delusion that I can be “one of the good ones” who doesn’t inconvenience drivers by riding to the left of the bike lane, taking up the “car” lane and preventing them from driving at their customary five miles over the speed limit. See, drivers? Bikes and cars can co-exist just fine, and I don’t have to be in your way! I don’t run stop signs, nor red lights, even though it would often afford me the opportunity to ride a few blocks without being in anyone’s way! I’m a responsible, law-abiding cyclist! Please don’t hurt me!

But I tried the losing side
I don’t want to die in here

Lately I’ve been getting the Mountain Goats’ song “Heel Turn 2,” from their 2015 album Beat the Champ, stuck in my head a lot while cycling. It’s a catchy song, of course, but I listen to a lot of those. For some reason, riding my bike in traffic seems to put me in the mood to ponder whether being one of the good ones is worth occasionally feeling like my life could be drastically changed or possibly ended in an instant by someone who failed to notice me, because I was being too polite, because I was trying not to inconvenience anyone. To “turn heel,” in professional wrestling, means basically to turn from a good guy to a bad guy. The protagonist in “Heel Turn 2” isn’t turning heel because they think it’d be fun. They’re doing it because they think it offers them a better shot at survival.

You found my breaking point, congratulations
Spent too much of my life now trying to play fair
Throw my better self overboard, shoot at him when he comes up for air

Would I feel safer, I wonder, if I tossed aside my compulsion to unobtrusiveness and did all the things that ensure that drivers notice you, sometimes at the cost of pissing them off? In some memorable cases, the answer seems to be a clear and terrifying no. But what if the cyclist had stayed courteously to the right, in the bike lane, and—as can happen at virtually any time, with little or no warning—been doored, and knocked directly into the path of that truck? How many instances of cars cutting me off to turn right across the bike lane in front of me could I avoid by just claiming the “car” lane, as is permitted by law in Washington and many other states, and denying them the ability to do so? How many cars could I prevent from passing me dangerously closely if I rode in the middle of the lane rather than courteously hugging the curb to allow them to pass? Is it worth it to be an impediment, but one who is sure to be noticed, if occasionally I incur the wrath of someone who thinks I’m out of my place and decides to try to scare me back into it? Would I rather risk injury by neglect, or by malevolence?

Let all the trash rain down from way up in the rafters
I’m walking out of here in one piece
Don’t care what comes after
Drive the wedge, torch the bridge
I don’t want to die in here

One of my friends went Full Heel Turn some time ago, at least presumably according to the hundreds of motorists he’s caught on video violating traffic laws and thereby endangering his and other cyclists’ lives who would prefer to do so unrecorded and unconfronted. I think about him and his way of life fairly often. Some of his confrontations with these motorists are scary. He’s got more guts than I even think I want to have, to knowingly inconvenience entitled people in two-ton armored vehicles and then demand they respect his dignity and safety when they get affronted, like they so often do. But I bet he doesn’t have problems with not being noticed.

        A Crow Looked At Me
    
    
    Every once in a while a music album comes along that just consumes me for a little while. I want to read everything anyone’s written about it to find out if it affected other people in the same way it did me and mine for insights and ways to put words to how it made me feel what I did. Mount Eerie’s A Crow Looked at Me is the latest such album. It’s about the recent death of Phil Elverum’s wife from pancreatic cancer, and it’s not hard to figure out, in broad strokes, why it affected me so powerfully after only a couple listens. (It’s because it’s crushingly sad.)

It’s All Right There In Front Of You
I’m interested in trying to pick apart how this album is so effective, because it seems un-pick-apartable. You go to the album’s Genius pageBecause even though Genius serves up two and a half megs of Javascript to show you nine hundred bytes of text, it’s still the best place to find up-to-date lyrics, alas.

 and look at the lyrics for the first song, “Real Death,” and tell me if you felt the need to click on any of those lyrics to have user annotations explain what they mean. The lines that hit the hardest, like “Real Death” and the first verse of “Swims”, don’t need any, like, exegesis. It’s all right there in front of you.
But I don’t think it’s as simple as saying A Crow Looked at Me derives its power from being plainspoken about emotional devastation. Another album from a couple years ago, Sun Kil Moon’s Benji, took a similar tack, and I hated it. It struck me as ham-handed, an unsubtle attempt to manipulate the listener’s emotions and not worth listening to more than once. Why bother? There’s nothing more to get out of the lyrics. It’s all right there in front of you.


A Pine Cone, Your Squeaking Chair
In case my own obvious ham-handedness in the last two paragraphs didn’t make it clear, my opposite stances on A Crow Looked at Me and Benji are untenable in light of my (remarkably similar) attempts to justify them. So why does A Crow Looked at Me work so much better? Let me excerpt a couple lyrics that highlight the difference between the approaches taken in these two superficially similar albums.
From Benji’s “Pray for Newtown”:

So when Christmas comes and you’re out running around
Take a moment to pause and think of the kids who died in Newtown
They went so young, who gave their lives
To make us stop and think and try to get it right
They went so young, a cloud so dark over them hung
And they left home, gave their mom and dad a kiss and a hug

From A Crow Looked at Me’s “Toothbrush/Trash”:

Today I just felt it for the first time
Three months and one day after you died
I realized that these photographs we have of you
Are slowly replacing the subtle familiar
Memory of what it’s like to know you’re in the other room
To hear you singing on the stairs
A movement, a pine cone, your squeaking chair
The quiet untreasured
In between times
The actual experience of you here
I can feel these memories escaping
Colonized by photos narrowed down and told my mind erasing
The echo of you in the house dies down

Looking at the difference between these two excerpts, I actually hate Benji a lot more than I did even the first time I listened to it. “Pray for Newtown” traffics in generalities and platitudes: “so young” not once but twice in one stanza, “gave their lives,” “a cloud so dark.” It reaches for some kind of moral lesson — “make us stop and think and try to get it right” — but again it’s so general as to be meaningless. And when it does deign to offer a concrete look at what it purports to portray, it feels like naked emotional manipulation (or just an attempt to make the lyrics scan) rather than an honest decision that those details improve the storytelling. Of course the kids gave their mom and dad a kiss and a hug before they left for school. This means nothing. It’s just clumsily pawing at my heartstrings. As my partner aptly put it when I was trying to talk through this post with her, it’s like Mark Kozelek read the Wikipedia entry on the Newtown shooting and used the information therein to write a song.I’m sorry if you listened to Benji and loved it. I didn’t start this post intending to bag on it so hard, and I know a lot of people thought it was great. But to me it just seems like dime-store pathos compared to the realness of the death in A Crow Looked at Me. And I should be up front about one other factor: from what I’ve read, Mark Kozelek seems like he personally is often a real asshole, where Phil Elverum seems like just the nicest and most gentle guy you can imagine. I’m sure this skews my opinion of their artistic output as well, so feel free to take it with as many grains of salt as you deem necessary.


Contrast “Toothbrush/Trash,” of whose lyrics my excerpt comprises about half. (The stanza I quoted from “Pray for Newtown” is one of nine.) It’s spare, economical with words but generous with details about the quiet hell Phil Elverum is living. “Three months and one day after you died.” “You singing on the stairs, a movement, a pinecone, a squeaking chair.” It’s every bit as plainspoken as anything on Benji, resorting only to the occasional figure of speech like “colonized by photos” and “the echo of you in the house.” But Phil Elverum ends lines with words that rhyme only when he can do so without compromising that straightforwardness, unlike “Pray for Newtown”’s clumsy “a cloud so dark over them hung.” Elverum has said that an alternate title for A Crow Looked at Me could be “Death is Real.” It’s a phrase that opens the album, and one he repeats throughout it as the reality of the death in his life intrudes on him again and again, making him intolerable to share a grocery aisle with, crushing him under its weight when he lets his guard down and dares to imagine a future conversation he might have with his wife.
A Crow Looked at Me does a lot with very little. On first listen, it might seem like it’s stream-of-consciousness, like each song was recorded straight through, one take, no lyrics written down. But I can’t believe that’s the case at all. The ache I feel listening to this album is too much for these anecdotes not to have been selected and tweaked for maximum effect, rather than just plucked haphazardly out of a constant stream of such moments in Phil Elverum’s life and dropped onto an album with no artifice whatsoever.
Please. Please. Someday this or something like it will happen to me. I have to believe it’s not always this bad.

        Bish Bosch
    
    
    My Favorite Albums of 2012 list omitted what was probably one of my most anticipated albums of the year. In fact, it didn’t make that list. The reason is not that it disappointed me—though in a way it did—but because even if it hadn’t it definitely would not be an album I’d want to return to often.
The album is Scott Walker’s Bish Bosch. Scott Walker is a fascinating man, and his recent musical history (where “recent” means “since about when I was born”; this is “recent” relative to Walker’s musical career stretching back to the 60s) is such that the release of Bish Bosch was quite a notable event. Walker’s last album The Drift was released in 2006. Its predecessor Tilt came out over a decade before that. In the 60s, Scott Walker was quite the pop heartthrob, I guess. His band The Walker Brothers had a hit single entitled “The Sun Ain’t Gonna Shine Anymore.” A few decades, fame-induced breakdowns and musical dead ends and false starts later, Walker is in another universe than ours, one where such a notion as “pop stardom” doesn’t exist, beaming back reports every five or ten years or so. It doesn’t sound like a pleasant place to be.
Bish Bosch, even more than The Drift and Tilt before it, is an otherworldly album. There are few melodies, and what melodies there are sure as hell aren’t tonal. Instead there are suffocating swathes of microtonal strings; detuned, distorted guitars twanging forlornly or forebodingly; unidentifiable electronics chittering prickly menace; and wide expanses of near-silence or ominous drones. Taken as a whole, it’s a nasty, perplexing, often outright hostile and abrasive slab of ugly words and noise as pitch-black as its cover. But it’s compelling despite all that, enough that I feel the need to write about it four years on.
I want to say the album flew under the radar of most people, and that I’m coming down from the mountain with a huge secret that no one else knows about. But it appeared on several other year-end lists, somewhat perversely. The New Yorker. My erstwhile favorite review site Cokemachineglow. It even made #1 on one list: according to Tiny Mix Tapes, Bish Bosch was the best album released in 2012.
This is hilarious in light of Tiny Mix Tapes’s name. Will anyone ever put a song from Bish Bosch on a mix tape? If I’d done so when I was making mix tapes for my girlfriend, she’d have thought I was a serial killer. Even “tiny” is laughable in this context. Any mix tape with a “late period” Scott Walker song on it is not tiny. Even his shortest songs can’t but be massive. All are black holes of the kind you can only form by compressing a novelette’s worth of fractured, inscrutable, hallucinatory lyrics, atonal melodies, and outright sound collage—years in the making—into a ten-song album totaling just over an hour.
The penultimate song in the three-album trilogy of sorts that Bish Bosch concludes, the shortest and possibly most digestible song in the whole batch (“digestible” being a nauseating and therefore appropriate word to use to refer to any song here, to be sure) is called “Pilgrim”. It’s about two and a half minutes long and its lyric totals about thirty different words. It could be said to have a pretty conventional structure, with a repeated verse and a bridge, if the verse is the part where Walker rasps “Heya, heya, heya, heya / Room full of mice” over a carpet of skittering drums and the bridge is the part where he sing-speaks about blowing up bullfrogs with a straw. Like much of Bish Bosch, it seems primarily about decay and wanton cruelty, if one had to say it’s “about” something. Other favorite subjects of Walker’s: disease (and the spread thereof), dictators (and the execution thereof).
It’s dark stuff, but Walker approaches it in an almost playful way. One of his favorite tricks is to take two seemingly unrelated ideas, toss them into a song together, and see what happens. Sometimes we get a kind of alchemy: he forges an unlikely connection between them, as in The Drift’s “Jesse”, where he almost makes us believe that the shade of Elvis Presley felt the fall of the Twin Towers as an ache mirroring the absense of his twin brother who died at birth. The absurdity of the connection on its face makes it all the more affecting when Walker sort of pulls it off.
Other times, as in Bish Bosch’s “The Day the ‘Conducator’ Died (An Xmas Song)”, the two ideas lie separate and inert. That song seems to make no attempt to tie together its “verse”’s unadorned recital of a personality questionaire (“Most of the chaos in my life is caused by / ○ Internal factors / ○ External factors”) and the “chorus” consisting of the single repeated line “Nobody waited for fire.” That line refers to the execution of the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, the Conducator of the title, where indeed the firing squad did not wait for the order to fire to do so. What are we to make of this juxtaposition? We’re left to connect the dots: is Walker suggesting that a personality inventory of this kind might determine if the listener is the type who would “wait for fire”? Is he inviting us to laugh at the existence of such personality tests in a world where people won’t give a man—brutal dictator though he may have been—a dignified death? How does the single, final, horribly skewed personality test question “The mad dogs swarming from her groin / ○ You noticed / ○ Didn’t Notice” fit in to all this? If there even is a right answer to any of these questions, I wouldn’t expect to have found it with any of my speculation. But of course it does force me to speculate. It’s easy to Google most of the references and allusions that Walker employs in his lyrics, but that just leaves you with two or more unwieldy, amorphous blobs of information, and no inkling of how they’re supposed to fit together.
It could all be unlistenably, intolerably, unrelentingly oppressive if Walker didn’t also have a sense of humor and a pretty deft compositional touch. He breaks up his claustrophobically intense crushes of noise with equally agoraphobic expanses of near-silence, which are a relief until they start to become ominous. And, even more so on Bish Bosch than before, his lyrics are shot through with non sequiturs which might have you raising an eyebrow or laughing out loud depending on how they catch you. Some examples:
From “Dimple”: “Frozen fast in the lowering night / In the lowering left-testicle night”
From “‘See You Don’t Bump His Head’”: “While plucking feathers from a swan song / Shit might pretzel Christ’s intestines”
From “Epizootics!”: “Oops, pardon the elbow / Let’s just shift you over here / Sorry / I’m so clumsy / Take that accidentally in the bollocks for a start”
From “Corps de Blah”: “Nothing clears a room like removing a brain.” (Or putting on a late-period Scott Walker album, one assumes.)
Of course, for every line such as the above, there are three more like “Epicanthic knobbler of ninon / Arch to Macaronic mahout in the mascon” or “Jutland is crooning narcrotic Lorilies” or “Down there, as ish kabibbles / Schlepp the shade forever.” Bish Bosch has a higher density of words whose definitions I don’t know than probably any other piece of media I’ve ever consumed, and there’s evidence that many of the words are Joycean gibberish of Walker’s own devising. (“Narcrotic,” for example, used back-to-back in “Epizootics!” and “Dimple,” appears to be a made-up portmanteau of “necrotic” and “narcotic.”)
But even through the haze of general inscrutability you can tell Bish Bosch is preoccupied with decay. Decay of the body, of course, especially in “Corps De Blah,” but also decay of information like the Biblical contradictions skewered in “Tar,” or “‘See You Don’t Bump His Head’”’s series of morbid snapshots: microscopic scavengers (“bdelloid rotifers” in the lyric) swarming, Donald Rumsfeld (“Rummy”) jabbering smugly, and “a tiny laugh” that “dirties everything it touches.”
But I haven’t even mentioned the album’s 20-minute centerpiece “SDSS14+16B (Zercon, A Flagpole Sitter)” yet! It is, according to a press release in advance of Bish Bosch, about two “brown dwarfs”: Zercon, a “Moorish jester” in the court of Attila the Hun, and SDSS14+16B, the coldest known substellar body in the universe. Apparently, over the course of the song, the former climbs a flagpole and turns into the latter, or tries to, or imagines he does. But I struggle to think anyone could determine this on their own if the press release hadn’t laid it out so clearly. A substantial part of the lyric consists of schoolyard insults (“Does your face hurt? / ’Cause it’s killing me!”), mostly not so much sung as declaimed, and bathroom-wall scrawlings like “For a Roman / Who’s proof that Greeks fucked bears / V, V, IX, VII, V, IV, I” (the Roman numerals, of course, being a phone number).
It’s a little curious that so much of this monster track, skulking in the hollowed-out heart of Bish Bosch, is so utterly trivial. Most of Bish Bosch stares into the abyss, and boy does it stare back. In a way, “Zercon” does the same, but it also reassures us, with a wink: Don’t worry. Your grossness, your run-of-the-mill vulgarity and petty cruelty, these will live on long after you. And somehow even after all this hostility and nonsense, it’s affecting when Zercon leaves it below him and attains the solitude he apparently craved atop his lonely flagpole. The heterogeneous cacophony that he’s spent most of the song trying to escape drops out to be replaced by thin, asphyxiating high-pitched strings, and he wails, “It’s so cold / Infrared / What if I freeze / And drop into / the darkness?”
I found it affecting, anyway. Maybe you will too, or maybe you’ll find something else affecting about Bish Bosch, but whether positively or negatively or, more likely, some mixture of both, it will probably affect the shit out of you. That’s why, after being compelled by unknown forces to throw it on again recently, I was then compelled to crack open this thing I’d started writing about it three years earlier and finally finish it. Here it is. Give Bish Bosch a listen. I promise it will be unlike anything you’ve heard before.

        MPD + Quicksilver on OS X
    
    
    I don’t know about you, but I let iTunes manage my music on Mac OS X and have done so for years, since when it was only kind of bloated and annoying instead of incredibly bloated and annoying like it is now. So even though iTunes itself is kind of awful at this point, all my music is organized the way iTunes likes to organize it, and most options for buying music have iTunes integration. iTunes is and has always been the path of least resistance for music management on a Mac.
But I don’t like using iTunes to play music anymore. Hell, I don’t even like to have it open most of the time, if I can avoid it. So I use mpd to play music instead. It stands for music player daemon and it’s just a process that runs constantly in the background and plays music when you ask it to. It’s not very user-friendly out of the box. With the help of the venerable and surprisingly still actually alive Quicksilver, I was able to make it more convenient and user-friendly. I set up a Git repository containing the helpers I used to set this up.
My music playing needs are pretty minimal but I like to have them streamlined. Here’s what this setup can do in one keystroke:

Search and play albums that iTunes knows about using Quicksilver’s fuzzy searching
Get the name of the song being played
Manage playback using media keys on a standard Apple keyboard

Unfortunately this path is not for the faint of heart. You should be comfortable with a terminal for it. At many points while setting it up I got the feeling I was continuing to work on it more out of sheer cussedness than because I thought it would ultimately be worth the time I was putting in. But now that I’ve blazed the trail maybe it will work a little better for you. Many of the difficulties stemmed from figuring out which dark corners of Quicksilver actually work as they’re supposed to, so hopefully those won’t cause you the same difficulty.
Good luck! If you try this, let me know about it on Twitter or star (or open an issue on) my GitHub repo!

        Mapping Grief By Reflections
    
    
    I mostly grieve second-hand.
Some combination of societal pressure and natural personal inclination seems to have inoculated me against the first-hand variety, so that I can, for example, look at the following facts directly in their loathsome faces and be relatively unscathed by them: My cat Einstein, the first cat who was really mine, rather than my family’s, is sick and going to die. The vet gave us a prognosis and at no point was there a mention of any time span greater than six months. We’re going to do what we can to spoil him and make him comfortable in this twilight of his life, and at some point — perhaps when he is no longer happy enough to grace us with his legendary, bone-shaking purr — we’ll have him put to sleep, and then all we’ll have of him will be memories.
Abstractly, it seems like those facts should be enough to make me a quivering mass. I mean, Einstein is like 18 now and I’ve been dreading the inevitability of having his health take a turn for probably a few years now. But now I’m in the midst of it, and how do I feel? Well, pretty fucking bad, actually, but mostly not in a sad way. Instead I’m anxious and fretful and distractable and I feel somehow fragile.
The weird physical manifestation of this fragility is sort of like a low-grade fever: a feeling that my skin is tender, like I have a mild sunburn on my chest and back. (I assume the slight edge of nausea is from anxiety.) But the real sense of fragility comes from the feeling that second-order grief could hit me even harder than it usually does. Second-order grief is listening to a sad song, or seeing someone else grieve openly. Maybe it’s that society trained me to respond to other people displaying grief even as it trained me out of doing so myself, or maybe it’s just that other people being unguarded with their emotions can get through my defenses in a way that I can’t do myself. The master’s tools can’t dismantle the master’s wall.
When my father died suddenly, the first time I cried was over a week later, when I saw my brother — the one reknowned for his ability to hold an absolutely straight face through any attempts to faze him — break down. On the other hand, the song “Virtute the Cat Explains Her Departure,” by the Weakerthans, is one of the few things in this world that can reliably bring me to tears. I love it, and hate it, precisely because of its ability to make me let down my guard in a way that it seems most other things can’t, and despite my girlfriend’s asking me “Why do you do that to yourself?” sometimes it just feels right to cry, the same way sometimes we intentionally do things that scare or hurt us in other ways. But now, in my current state of fragility, I’m afraid to listen to that song. Maybe I don’t want to cry when there’s a chance that some part of it might be real, that Einstein is sad and afraid and in pain and there’s nothing I can do about it. Usually I can resist anthropomorphizing him this way. But that song shatters my resistance in too many ways for me to risk it.
Someday soon I will wake up and, for the first time in nine years, there will no longer be an Einstein. I know this, and I can face it and be mostly unmoved. But if I listen to Woke Up New, even though it is about a person and not a cat, that “what do I do without you” will somehow make it real. And I’ll have to really confront how maybe, some cold winter morning after Einstein leaves, it will be cold, so I’ll put on a sweater and turn up the heat, and then, suddenly and without warning, the walls will begin to close in, and there will be absolutely nothing I can do about it.

        Poison Season : Kaputt :: Trouble in Dreams : Destroyer&#39;s Rubies
    
    
    I’ve mentioned the analogy in this post’s title to a couple hard-core Destroyer fans — my brother, and my best friend I’ve never met in person Jeff Hume — and both had an initial reaction that suggested nonplussedness or at least extreme puzzlement. So here’s what I mean.
I don’t just mean that Poison Season is the LP following Kaputt, but let’s start with that fact. I mean that Poison Season is both a recoiling from and an expansion on Kaputt in a similar way that Trouble in Dreams was to Destroyer’s Rubies. I use the term “recoiling” because of an interview Dan Bejar did with Pitchfork where he expressed discomfort, or something, at having found himself playing large festivals in the wake of Kaputt:

I remember being at Coachella and thinking, “What the fuck am I doing here?” That’s just one obvious one. But I didn’t have to play Coachella. No one forced me. That was a choice and that’s me just dabbling in this certain careerist version of myself. It fucking exists! I don’t regret it, though, and I’m really proud of Kaputt. But it became clear to me very quickly that there are a few places where I have no business being—and that I wasn’t going to be returning to those places again, whether out of my own volition or because I would not be invited back.

In the same interview, you can (unsurprisingly) sense Bejar’s intent to withdraw from the crowd-pleasing pop of Kaputt that ended up with him on the stage at Coachella in the first place.
Though I don’t have nor intend to try to look up interview evidence supporting it, I submit that this isn’t a new pattern. Prior to Kaputt, the last time Bejar made a relatively straightforward and accessible rock record and got approving press for it, it was Destroyer’s Rubies. He followed that up with Trouble in Dreams which was possibly his most widely panned (well, let’s say least critically lauded; Destroyer is a band that critics tend to love) album in a decade. Perhaps its best competition for that dubious prize would be 2002’s This Night, which — insofar as any Destroyer album resembles another — is also probably the one most like Trouble in Dreams: it’s guitar-heavy, a little glammy, a little shambolic, a little longer and more indulgent than it maybe needs to be. Of course, This Night came a year after Streethawk: A Seduction, certainly the most consistent and highly regarded Destroyer album pre-Rubies! Keeping in mind that this post’s title’s analogy is a loose one, it would work equally well expanded to include This Night : Streethawk too.
Musically, Bejar alludes to Poison Season’s having two main vibes, which are pretty apparent when you give it a spin. The straight-up 70s-ish pop rock of “Dream Lover” and “Times Square” is superficially reminiscent of several other Destroyer albums, and I’m pretty sure it actually re-uses a handful of riffs from Trouble in Dreams. There’s also the chamber pop using classical instruments like you hear on the bookend/title tracks and in the first half of “Hell”. If the Destroyer album that Trouble in Dreams most resembles is This Night, what precedent does Poison Season’s chamber pop have? Die-hard fans will already know where I’m going with this: Your Blues, the MIDI-orchestrated (and enjoyable but also quite outré and critic- and mainstream-befuddling) follow-up to This Night.
Critical consensus has largely come to the conclusion that Rubies and Kaputt are Destroyer’s masterpieces to date, and like Trouble in Dreams before it, Poison Season sounds like a transitional work in the wake of one of those masterpieces: lacking its cohesion and instead sort of straddling two worlds, a little more uneven, a little harder to pin down, maybe a little harder to love, or maybe a little harder to admire and a little easier to love because of it. I don’t love Poison Season but I didn’t want another Kaputt, so I’m happy that it’s surprising and kind of murky and difficult.
I don’t mean to say that Bejar is starting to just tread old ground and repeat himself. These newer albums are also evolutions on the old ones they superficially resemble, and no one who’s listened to them more than a couple times would mistake Trouble in Dreams for This Night or Poison Season for Your Blues. Nor do I mean to say that Dan Bejar’s artistic direction is informed only by his desire to avoid the glare of the spotlight: he’s clearly doing what interests him. Hell, he even said in an interview that Poison Season is “what’s closest to [his] heart right now,” which is kind of delightful and reassuring coming from a man who in recent years has been given to pronouncements like “The English language seemed spent, despicable, not easily singable. It felt over for English; good for business transactions, but that’s about it,” and “I think I also lost complete interest and faith in indie rock music being a serious forum for writing” and (in his song “Grief Point”) “I have lost interest in music. It is horrible.” From the standpoint of that last quote, Poison Season is a relief. It’ll never be my favorite Destroyer album, but it’s not something made by someone who’s lost interest in music, and we should all be thankful for that.

        Spacemacs
    
    
    
A Vimmer’s Emacs Prerequisites
In a previous post I explained why Vim and Sublime Text ultimately disappointed me; in this one, I’m going to describe how I finally found at least temporary respite in Emacs and what it took to get me there.
I had a rocky start with Emacs. Actually I had about four of them. There was never any question that I was going to use Evil-mode, Emacs’s vi emulation layer. I understand that it arose from the ashes of several previous such efforts to become one of the most complete vi emulations available for any text editor besides ones that derive from vi itself.
Coming from Sublime Text’s deeply inadequate or flawed vi emulation packages, Evil was a revelation. With very few exceptions, it really is just like using Vim. It’s all that other crap that Emacs does that I had to make sense of somehow and that tripped me up the first several times I made a serious attempt at learning it.
One of the popular jokes about Emacs is that it stands for “Escape Meta Alt Control Shift”, a jab at the countless arcane key chords that you’re expected to use to invoke its mind-boggling array of features. Almost immediately, I decided that finding a way to avoid those chords in favor of using Vim-style key sequences mostly without modifiers would be a prerequisite for my using Emacs full time.
To make this distinction a bit clearer: The key command to quit Emacs is C-x C-c, which means “control-x followed by control-c”. Take a look at this table of Emacs commands and you’ll get an idea why there’s a whole flavor of RSI named for Emacs and why I wanted to just swap those key bindings out from the get go. What I really wanted was to bulk-convert all of Emacs’s RSI-inducing chords to key sequences like ones using Vim’s leader keys: for example, the aforementioned C-x C-c might become \xc or something.
My first pass at this had me using god-mode to take a bunch of the modifiers out of Emacs commands. But I had some trouble getting god-mode to play nice with Evil, even when I used the charmingly titled evil-god-state to tie the two together. I suspect that this was actually a perfectly viable way to achieve what I wanted and some misunderstanding on my part prevented me from getting it working; I was too new to Emacs and tried to deviate from its norms too much too fast. If you use evil-mode and god-mode together I’d be interested to hear how it works for you.
By this point I’d dipped my toes into Emacs enough to have a handle on Emacs Lisp, the (far superior to Vimscript) language used to do all of Emacs’s extensive customization. I’d tried the “build up an Emacs config from scratch” thing a couple times and ended up frustrated with it due to its being a total crap shoot whether any given plugin would play nice with evil-mode. So when I came across a starter kit whose tagline is “The best editor is neither Emacs nor Vim, it’s Emacs and Vim!”, and which purports to be “first intended to be used by Vim users who want to go to the next level by using Emacs”, I was 100% ready to jump feet-first into an unabashedly Evil-centric starter kit.


Spacemacs
Here’s the link to that starter kit, which is called Spacemacs. It takes Vim’s leader key idea and kicks it into overdrive with the help of a plugin that provides the same functionality in Evil, setting the leader key to space (whence the starter kit’s name) and using it to replace a whole bunch of Emacs chords with modifier-free key sequences.
This approach is pretty similar to the one I had in mind with evil-god-state, though it doesn’t automatically translate Emacs bindings like I’d hoped. But that turned out not to be as big a problem as I thought: Emacs does so much that I don’t really want to have it all at my fingertips. Manually setting up my bindings helps me compartmentalize, adding a few at a time and assimilating them while I note what continues to be most frictionful so I can try to ameliorate it in my next round of bindings. And Spacemacs sets up a ton of bindings for you, using a sort of “namespaced” hierarchy that allows all those bindings to avoid stepping on each other’s toes while also encouraging mnemonics and working well with a nice feature that aids discoverability.
That’s not the only way that Spacemacs is smartly designed. Its overall architecture is such that it’s (relatively) welcoming for the newbie but has a framework for sensible extensibility when you get further into it. I’ll explain some of the things that were most helpful to me in making Emacs with Spacemacs my full-time editor:

Getting Started with Spacemacs
Memorizing these bindings will enable you to get around in Spacemacs, if occasionally somewhat clumsily. They were my bread and butter before I started to do my own configuration. I’m only mentioning Emacs-specific bindings here; note that most of the basic functionality of Vim also works well in Spacemacs, like invoking Ex mode with : and using it to do things like save and open files, split windows, etc.

&lt;SPC&gt; f f: Mnemonic “find file”. Triggers the function ido-find-file, which lets you use Ido to navigate your filesystem to find a file to open, starting from the directory of the current buffer. A crash course: &lt;Tab&gt; will autocomplete. Deleting when there’s no text after a slash will go up a directory. ~/ will take you to your home directly from anywhere. // will take you to your filesystem root from anywhere. &lt;Return&gt; will go into the selected directory or open the selected file.
&lt;SPC&gt; b b: Mnemonic “buffer buffer”. Opens a Helm minibuffer with a list of all your open buffers as well as recently visited ones. The biggest thing to know about Helm is that &lt;Tab&gt; doesn’t autocomplete. Instead, Helm filters the list as you type and you just select the best match using &lt;Return&gt;. It does a great deal of more fancy stuff too, but for switching buffers, that will probably suffice.
&lt;SPC&gt; :: no mnemonic, but think of this as the Emacs equivalent of using : to bring up the Ex command line in Vim. It brings up a Helm buffer that you can use to find an interactive Emacs function to run. There are about thirty million of these and I’m not going to really mention any here, but if you’re reading something about Emacs and you see some hyphen-separated name like emacs-do-thing it’s probably a function you can call using &lt;SPC&gt; :. If you’re already familiar with Emacs (or looking at non-Spacemacs-centric Emacs docs), this is the equivalent of the ubiquitous M-x binding, but better because of Helm’s fuzzy matching.
&lt;SPC&gt; h d f: Mnemonic “help define function”. Man, so I complained about Vim and Sublime Text in my last post here. Sublime Text’s documentation is mediocre at best whereas Vim’s is very good and thorough, but even after working with Vim’s generally excellent documentation, Emacs’s is a revelation. There’s a reason that the blurb on the official Emacs web page describes it as “the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time display editor.” Being able to use this binding, in conjunction with Helm for fuzzy matching, to quickly find any function defined anywhere in Emacs including custom ones, and get generally very useful information about how to use it… it’s amazing how much of a difference it makes in learning how to use Emacs productively. Seriously, learn to love this binding. It even reports any custom bindings that are defined to invoke the function that you’re getting help on.
&lt;SPC&gt; h d k: Mnemonic “help define key”. Another example of Emacs’s excellent built-in help, this binding prompts for more keys and then tells you what they do. If you accidentally hit some key or something doesn’t do what you expect, this binding will tell you what it did. It’s slightly less useful than the previous binding in my experience, but still very useful.
&lt;SPC&gt;: As in, hit the space bar and then just wait. A feature (alluded to above) called guide-key will kick in and list the keys you can use to continue issuing a command, with a short description of what each does. At first most of them will start with “group”; this is the “namespacing” I was referring to earlier. For example, the previous two bindings in this list are in the “help-describe” subgroup of the “helm/help/highlight” top-level group. This hierarchical organization of bindings makes it reasonably plausible that you can discover the binding for a task you want using guide-key alone.

Those bindings, along with Spacemacs’s very good documentation of its own, should be enough to get you started on getting used to the brave new world of Emacs: if you’re a Vim user already, you’re probably familiar with the process of starting with a small set of commands and gradually incorporating new ones into your workflow as you learn where your friction areas are. You’ll have to go through that again with Spacemacs, but having a huge chunk of Vim’s functionality already available makes the process a lot smoother. I know, for example, that there’s a Spacemacs binding for saving a buffer, but I don’t yet know what it is because I always just use the Vim-style :w instead.
Hopefully that’s enough for you to get started using Spacemacs! It’s a really nice piece of work and it seems to be deservedly catching on like wildfire, so if you’re familiar with Vim and anything I’ve said here sounds appealing, you should give it a try.

        Pi Day Curmudgeonliness
    
    
    Happy Arbitrary Number Of Convenient Yet Also Arbitrary Time Units Elapsed Since The Death of a Historical Figure— Whose Divinity, If You’re Reading This, You Probably Don’t Even Believe In— Happening to Match Our Physiologically-Based (But Also Arbitrary) Number System Representation Of An Actually Fundamental Universal Constant Day!
Once upon a time I was enthusiastic about Pi Day, but I’ve become a bit of a curmudgeon about it without even realizing it. Much of it is due to typical hipster nonsense, probably, the “I was into math before you posers,” kind of thing when I see like fifty pictures of pies pop up on my Facebook wall. But my first paragraph sums up my more palatable reason, which Vi Hart expounds on at even more length with somewhat more verve but about as much use of the word “arbitrary”.
And I think that’s what my grumpiness about Pi Day comes down to: for a day ostensibly about celebrating a mathematical constant that’s remarkable for its timelessness and transcendence (little math joke there) of human conventions, Pi Day sure is contingent on a lot of those conventions. Pi, as the ratio of a circle’s diameter to its circumference, cares not about what number system we use to express it, or what year it is, or (I’d claim, as a mathematical Platonist) whether humans or any intelligent life even exist to know about it and give it a name. It’s just there, and it will always be there. I don’t think I’m irreverent about Pi Day. I think it’s my reverence for pi that makes me feel Pi Day itself is irreverent.
Still, though… it is nice to see the oft-maligned discipline of mathematics get a day in the sun, however superficial I may find it. And as a lapsed mathematician it’s unbecoming for me to be too snooty about it. So despite the arbitrariness of the day, I wanted to blog about some of the paths that complaining about Pi Day led me down. This will be very, very digressive and stream-of-consciousness. But the point is that thinking about Pi Day, despite its blatant disrespect of Pi’s sublime universality, can lead to some interesting if only tangentially related (another little math joke there) facts and curiousities. And isn’t knowledge what Pi Day should rightly be about?

Arbitrary Time Units
I started thinking about the arbitrariness of Pi Day’s relation to the Judeo-Christian Gregorian calendar and what more universal and unambiguous metrics it’s based on. I don’t think there’s anything to be done about the (to me as a non-Christian) arbitrariness of Pi Day’s being relative to the date of the birth of Jesus Christ (does this mean that Pi Day should be far more meaningful to Christians, who attach a profound and universal significance to that date?), but what about the divisions of time?
Modern science, which deals in particles that exist for far less than one-billionth of one billionth of one second, would not be satisfied with the imprecision in the layperson’s definition of a second as 1/31,536,000 of the time it takes for the Earth to revolve around the sun (or 1/86,400 of the time it takes for it to rotate once). The difference between any such revolution and the next is surely long enough for countless Higgs bosons to be created and destroyed. But the second is a Système International base unit. How is it measured these days in a way that’s good enough for science on this level?
The answer is quite arcane:

The second is the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom.

but it’s interesting because of the lengths that people presumably had to go to in order to ground what we’d already defined as a second in something that doesn’t change every time a comet swings by and tugs something a bit. And even decades after that definition was cooked up, it had to be amended to specify that it refers to the caesium atom at a temperature of absolute zero, because the radiation implied by a nonzero ambient temperature can affect the above measurement. In practice, this means no real-world clock can measure a second directly according to the strict definition. They have to use whatever temperature they can hold stable and extrapolate based on that what the measurement would be at absolute zero.


How Universal Is Pi?
Looking at the contortions necessary to make a “second” something that’s useful for high-precision science got me wondering whether my understanding of pi is as “universal” as I reverently assume it is. In particular, our value of 3.14 and so on is based on a circle in Euclidean geometry, which is characterized by the axiom that given a line L and a point P not on that line, there is exactly one line through P parallel to L. That seems obvious, but in fact you you can instead declare that there are no lines through P that parallel L or that there are infinitely many such lines and get perfectly coherent and even wildly useful systems.
If you make the first of those two assumptions, you get something called spherical geometry, called that because things work as if they were all on a sphere. In spherical geometry, the angles of a triangle add up to more than 180 degrees (or π radians, if you prefer) and there’s no such thing as parallel lines; all lines intersect. Circles on a sphere look much like they do in “flat” Euclidean geometry, (although some circles in spherical geometry, known as “great circles”, are also lines) but if you measure distance along the surface of the sphere, their circumference-to-diameter ratio is not what we know as π! In fact that ratio is 2 for the great circles and gets closer to our π as the circles get smaller! Under the second assumption, in hyperbolic geometry, instead the ratio is greater than our π (though, again, it gets closer to π as the circles get smaller because both hyperbolic and spherical geometry look like Euclidean geometry if you zoom in real close).
So dang, I should reconsider my position on my high horse. The only reason I think of pi as “universal” is that I privilege Euclidean geometry over the spherical and hyperbolic kind! There’s no compelling objective reason that we should say pi (defined as the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter) is approximately 3.14 at all; instead all we can say is that that’s the case in Euclidean geometry. Pure mathematics views the three geometries I mention as derived from collections of axioms. By itself, it doesn’t favor any of them over the others. And why should we even prefer Euclidean geometry when we live on a sphere?


Privilege
Realizing that the mathematical constant that I revere (so much that I smugly look down on those who celebrate it in a way that I think undercuts its real value) is actually contingent on a specific geometry which we designate as “the standard” one just because it’s most convenient to us is a sort of mathematical “checking my privilege.”
Checking your privilege just means to acknowledge the biases that arise from your personal experience and circumstances (which may differ hugely from those of other people) when you think about or discuss an issue. It’s become a sort of shibboleth of the left wing in American political discourse. A lot of people think it’s primarily a way to shut down conversations about the kinds of “hot button” topics where privilege is most relevant: race, class, gender, religious belief, disabilities. And indeed it can be used that way. But I think it’s a valuable thing to be aware of how your life experiences have been shaped by cultural forces and how those experiences shape your beliefs and assumptions in turn.
In the case of π, what I thought was a universal and fundamental value turned out only to be applicable to one specific set of axioms: axioms which were (not to put too fine a point on it) laid out by a white man in 300 BC. Of course I am not proposing that, had Euclid not been a white man, we would have discovered non-Euclidean geometry in less than the two millennia it actually took. But what if instead of following the paths laid down by a mathematician who did all his scratchwork on flat surfaces, we’d had other geometrical prodigies who used (cylindrical) tree trunks instead?
I follow a lot of disputes about pop culture and a common argument against adding “diverse” characters to media is that there’s no reason to “change” it or “try to make a statement.” People who make such arguments assume, based on privileges that they probably haven’t realized they enjoy, that the straight white male is the default and that using characters who don’t fit that mold is a conscious choice to deviate from that default. But maybe some people don’t fit that demographic and have different defaults. Maybe, like with Euclidean, spherical and hyperbolic geometry, there’s not really a good reason to prefer just one of them and disciplines flourish when they stop pretending there is, like geometry did at the beginning of the 19th century.
It seems like there are solid reasons to prefer Euclidean geometry, but it’s what we’re taught in school, and the mathematical canon looked at everything through that lens for almost two thousand years. Maybe math would be further along right now if we’d given those other geometries more credence between 300 B.C. and 1800 A.D. And maybe we’d make more progress faster even today if we aggressively gave more voice to people who don’t fit in with what people assume is the default.



Appendix: My Favorite Facts About π
Originally I omitted this section of this post, but I decided to add it as a palate cleanser and to demonstrate my solidarity with what I concluded earlier was the noble purpose of Pi Day: to spread the joy of mathematical knowledge. (Although I think that spreading awareness of privilege would be an even more noble purpose.)
There are two and a half one and a half facts about pi that leap to my mind due to their surprisingness and elegance whenever the subject of “how pi is interesting” comes up. (One and a half because one of them is only sort of “about” pi, down from two and a half because in writing this I learned that one isn’t actually true.) Here they are:

The Basel Problem, a.k.a. the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the natural numbers
Soooo one of those names doesn’t tell you anything about this problem and the other is maybe a little dense to try to unpack, so this is a maybe slightly more friendly version of it: 
(Clicking that image will take you to the Wikipedia page for the problem, which goes way more in depth than I intend to here.)
I love this fact because it’s easy to state precisely— twelve English words is far fewer than many interesting math problems take to state, and the mathematical representation is tidier still— but the result is extremely surprising and ties into some math so deep that I’d quickly be way over my head if I attempted to do more than gloss over it here.
If you’re not familiar with the notation, you only need to worry about the stuff after the second equals. The three things in between the equals signs all say the same thing. If you’re not familiar with infinite sums, they basically ask two questions: “if you keep adding those fractions up, will the sum eventually ‘even out’ at a particular number? If so, what number is that?”
Here, the answer to the first question is “yes,” and the answer to the second one is “π²/6”.
Yes! You read that right. If you keep adding up those fractions, with the squares of the natural numbers in the denominators, the sum will keep getting closer and closer to π²/6. Where does the π come in when we’re adding up these simple fractions? Well, as you’ll see if you check that Wikipedia article, the answer involves some pretty sophisticated mathematical machinery and (you may have to take my word for this part) a sizable dollop of cleverness as well. Just to add up some (ok, infinitely many) simple fractions, and get an answer that involves an irrational number! The problem took 90 years to solve after it was first posed and another 6 to prove rigorously. It’s beautiful and elegant, one of my favorite mathematical facts. And as a bonus, it also relates to the function ζ, a.k.a. the Riemann Zeta Function: one of the most important functions in mathematics, with still more surprising implications relating to the distribution of prime numbers, one of math’s most enduring mysteries.


Average river sinuosity
The sinuosity of a river is the ratio of its length with all its twists and turns included to its length “as the crow flies.” Up until this very day, I believed that the average sinuosity of the world’s rivers was approximately equal to pi.
But thanks to the Internet, it’s not difficult to check this and find that it’s almost certainly not true. A gentleman who writes for the Guardian used the data crowdsourced in that last link to write a column about the debunking. It turns out that the “fact” was based in part on a simulation, not actual measurements of real-world rivers. Perhaps in a more mathematically ideal world, where rivers are free to go where they will without being disrupted by weather or other large-scale geographic events, it would actually be true. But in this one, it appears it’s actually not.


Euler’s identity
This is my “half a fact” about pi, which includes pi but isn’t really about it, but for my money it’s the most beautiful and elegant fact in mathematics. Behold:

You don’t have to take my word for it. The Wikipedia article linked from the picture above has an entire section entitled “Mathematical beauty.” Euler’s identity is even more elegant to state than the Basel problem, and it ties together five of the most fundamental and important mathematical constants— e, i, π, 0 and 1— in a totally unexpected and concise way. If there’s one thing that you as a (presumed) layperson can do to understand why mathematicians so often refer to their discipline as “beautiful,” it’s to learn about the different parts of Euler’s identity and why it’s so remarkable that they fit together in such a simple way. That would be an excellent way to celebrate Pi Day.




Actually, I know the reason for this. It’s the same reason that we use Newtonian mechanics for when you throw a ball rather than relativity or quantum mechanics: it’s a hell of a lot simpler and more familiar, and for most of your purposes it’ll be more than good enough.


Also, Euclidean geometry does the job on a spherical Earth because, much to the detriment of many B.C. cultures, a sphere is an awful lot like a flat plane if you’re only looking at a tiny piece of it. ↩︎



Well, the Western canon certainly represents him as white. But then, it does the same for the middle-Eastern Jesus… ↩︎

        My Own Personal Editor War
    
    
    I’m a stickler for dev tools, in particular text editors, almost to a fault. Okay, definitely to a fault. Okay, probably well past the point where any reasonable person would call it a fault.
For a long time after Vim opened my eyes to the power of a Real Text Editor and the fun and effortless feeling of modal editing, I tried to do as much code and longform writing as possible in it, or at least some editor with a decent emulation of its keybindings. But at some point in the last several years there’s been an explosion of good editors, many of which fit that latter criteria. So I took the opportunity to explore a few of them and try to find one that would do away with Vim’s shortcomings while still giving me that sweet, sweet modal editing that I so crave.

What’s Wrong With Vim?
Why did I want to move away from Vim? It’s the original modal editor (well, not counting vi) and it has a hugely robust ecosystem and userbase that makes the solution to almost any problem a Google search away.
But it also has some limitations, baked in at a very low level, that grated on me more and more until I finally wanted to see if I could do better. Some of those limitations:

Bluntly, Vim is Just a Text Editor and attempts to turn it into an IDE are doomed to kludginess at best and frustration and failure at worst as you tack on dozens of plugins in order to achieve what any IDE worth its salt would call basic functionality.
Perhaps the situation in the above point would be okay if the dozens of plugins I alluded to had better cross-platform support. But due to circumstances beyond my control I have to use Windows at work, and time and time again while trying to set up a Vim plugin I’d see something to the effect of “Tested on OS X and Linux, seems to work on Windows, but YMMV” in its GitHub readme. Pile enough code with disclaimers like that on top of itself and it’s a recipe for disaster.
I know, I know: it’s open source, fix it yourself, yadda yadda. But Vim plugins are mostly written in Vimscript, a wonky, frustrating, Vim-exclusive language that I really have no interest in learning.
At some point in my investigation of other editors, I got addicted to having a linter running alongside my editing in realtime. Since I code mostly in Python at work, a linter can catch a lot of errors before I run anything, which can save me a lot of time. But the only way to get the kind of asynchronous/multi-threaded process support that you need for real-time linting in Vim is to use an experimental fork that will probably never be merged into Vim proper or some kind of other kludge which requires compiling an “external c helper application” and I bet works just great on Windows.
Related to that last point: Vim dates from 1991, and looks it. It’s based on vi, which is from the late 1970s and ran only in a terminal. Vim has a “GUI” mode, but it’s little more than a glorified terminal: its rendering is strictly grid-based; it supports only one font at a time; and any “graphics” that you can get in it are actually just text, so even many of the most attractive Vim setups have rough edges and a feeling of being dated.
Like a lot of other people, I have my fingers crossed that Neovim will get off the ground, because I think it will solve a lot of these problems. But I want an editor I can use and enjoy now.
The final nail in Vim’s coffin, as far as using it for heavier IDE-type coding, was trying out Sublime Text for a while.



Sublime
Sublime Text’s main advantages over Vim, for me:

Its cross-platform support is better.
Its IDE-esque capabilities are better. In particular, I don’t think I’ve ever found a project management system that I like as much as ST’s, and its Goto Anything feature is really slick.
It starts up faster than a Vim that’s sufficiently tricked out to be equally capable.
It strikes a good balance between “just a text editor” and “fucking Eclipse”.
It uses Python as an extension language.
It’s much prettier than Vim. This is something that I’ve been led to believe I shouldn’t care about as a Coder, but I’m also a lifelong Mac user, so I do care. Sue me.

Like Vim, though, Sublime started to show cracks after a while. Unfortunately this happened after I already paid for it, but I got enough use out of it (and learned enough from it about what I will and won’t put up with in my tools) that I consider that money reasonably well spent. For the record, though, a list of my grievances:

The vi emulation plugin, “Vintage mode,” seems decent at first glance but after sustained use turns out to be pretty deficient: many commands are missing or behave incorrectly, and the plugin has had very few updates to fix them in the last couple years. (More on this later.) There’s an alternative third-party plugin that’s more complete, but it still has a brace of bugs and shortcomings that are frustrating to anyone used to actual Vim, particularly in the area of defining new keybindings. Basically, the vi emulation situation in Sublime is spotty at best.
The cross-platform situation is better than Vim, but there are still some patchy bits of the preferences system that made sharing prefs in Dropbox between my work Windows machine and my home Mac a chore. In particular: the User preferences, where you’re supposed to make your personal configuration changes, are shared on all platforms, which is suboptimal. To get platform-specific settings, I had to configure them in a place I wasn’t supposed to, which of course caused problems elsewhere.
The developer is almost completely incommunicado. Bugs and feature requests are slow to be addressed if they’re addressed at all.
Relatedly, documentation is often outdated or incomplete and shows no signs of being updated, so a community documentation project has arisen to fill in the gaps. This and the previous point are pretty unacceptable for a paid product, in my opinion. This review concurs, a little more frothily than this blog post. (NB: at least some of the quotes in the “Stupid, stupid docs” section have been excised from the unofficial docs, but I can corroborate that they were once there. Hell, I even submitted a pull request to remove the worst of them myself.)

I probably could have lived with these problems. Sublime has the nice asynchronous linting I crave and just the right amount of IDE features, and I encounter few enough bugs in my routine ST usage that my last two complaints were mostly ideological rather than practical. But still. There’s got to be something better, right?
Well, spoiler alert: after years as a Vim user hearing about how it’s a ridiculous nonsense program that’s too big for its britches, I’m currently using Emacs and, on the whole, liking it more than I did Vim or ST when I got fed up with them. But because Emacs is not a text editor but a tiny universe, it took me four or five false starts before I finally found a way in that worked for me. I’ll describe it in a future post.

        My Best Bug Fix of the Year
    
    
    If you don’t know what UTF-16 surrogates are and how they work, consider my Unicode essay required reading for this post.
This is a story about the most confounding bug that I fixed at work this year.

Mangled Emoji
I had a problem with a Visual C++ program at work: it was mangling some emoji characters that it wrote to a text file using the probably non-standard ccs flag (see the “Unicode Support” sub-section of that document) to encode them as UTF-16. The mangling happened like this example: instead of writing a 🎨, the program would write ��.
That’s not your browser failing to display two characters. That’s what I saw in the text file, and I thought the same thing as you might have just now: that my editor was failing to display characters because it didn’t have a font for them or something. But I opened that file up in a hex editor: those two characters were supposed to look like that, because they were both the Unicode replacement character, code point U+FFFD. So it wasn’t that the text editor couldn’t display the output correctly. My C++ code was writing two replacement characters instead of an emoji for some reason.


Fruitless Debugging
I spent the better part of an afternoon trying fruitlessly to figure out why this was happening, going so far as to follow the debugger down into the depths of Microsoft’s file-handling C code where every variable and function is prefixed by between one and three underscores and all data processing happens on the byte level.
(I am ordinarily a Python weenie, but this code was actually surprisingly easy to follow. Still, when you’re used to processing an entire file using one or two lines of code, it does all seem unbearably tedious.)
Anyway, I was able to ascertain to the best of my understanding that at the time the emoji’s bytes were actually copied to the file pointer, those bytes were indeed d8 3c df a8, the UTF-16 encoding of 🎨, with the first two bytes constituting a surrogate. Nevertheless, when I opened that file after letting the program finish, there were those ��s like a pair of malevolent eyes, mocking me. Tormenting me.
I called it a day and went home.


Sleeping on it
The next day I was able to look at the problem with fresh eyes. It’s a commonly reiterated—but scientifically defensible—truism that if you get stuck on a problem, one of the most helpful things to do is sleep on it. I believe this and I’ve experienced it myself several times, but I’m still always surprised when it works, and this time was no exception.
Here is what my sleep-freshened eyes were able to see and synthesize the next day:

The problem happened inconsistently, in that if an emoji appeared twice in an input file, one of them might turn into ��s in the output file but the other might not.
But it also happened reliably, in that I could reproduce it in the same place every time I ran the program with the same input.
Even down in the murky depths of the C libraries, there was no point at which I saw anything corresponding to �� in any buffer in the debugger.
The problem happened only for the emoji in the output files. No other characters were affected.
I mentioned this before, but to reiterate: the output file did actually contain the bytes corresponding to ��, and their appearing was not due to an issue with rendering or fonts.
Perhaps the key insight I hadn’t had before: at no point during my debugging did I actually see any code that would handle the encoding of the text (which was stored in arrays of 2-byte wchar_ts in the code) to UTF-16 bytes.

Because of the last point in that list, it seemed like the problem had to be in the UTF-16 encoding process that I wasn’t seeing, because it didn’t seem to be anywhere else. A problem with the encoding would certainly explain how the four bytes in the UTF-16 encoding of 🎨—two wchar_ts’ worth—could turn into two replacement characters used to indicate an incorrect encoding. If you were to split those bytes in half in some reason, you’d get d8 3c and df a8, neither of which are valid on their own in UTF-16 and would therefore get turned into replacement characters by an encoder.
Putting this all together, I realized that the UTF-16 encoding must have been happening in an even murkier place than the ones I’d previously plumbed: when the emoji was flushed from a buffer onto the disk. This is common when writing to a file: when you send characters to a file handle, they’re actually sneakily just stored in memory until you have a big chunk of them that you can dump to the disk all at the same time and make that relatively slow disk IO worth the time it takes.
If it just so happened that the C internals decided to flush my buffer in between the two wchar_ts that constituted my emoji, they’d see a d8 3c at the end of the first buffer and a df a8 at the beginning of the second one. The UTF-16 encoding process wouldn’t know what to do with either of them on their own, and by way of saying so, it’d turn both to replacement characters.
As with many bugs that you work on consciously for six hours and subconsciously for another eight, the fix for this one took fewer than ten lines of code to manually flush the file buffer a little more often in order to ensure that it didn’t do so in the middle of a UTF-16 surrogate pair. It was kind of a lot of work to fix a very minor problem, but on the other hand, based on my fruitless Google searching to try to figure out what was going on here, I think I may have been the first one to find this bug in Microsoft’s UTF-16 handling, and that’s kind of exciting.
Anyway, not with a bang but with a whimper does this post about my best bug fix of the year end. Sleep on your problems, folks. It works.




This is the footiest footnote I think I’ve ever written in that it has nothing whatsoever to do with the main body of this post, but: when compiling these links from the front page of a Google search, the following did not escape my notice:


People in the UK seem to be really fond of this idea; of the 5 links I used here, which constituted most of the aforementioned first page of search results, 4 are from UK websites; is “sleep on a problem” a British phrase?


Also, 3 of the 5 articles I linked are accompanied by a stock photo of a conventionally attractive young white woman sleeping (it was 4 out of 5, but I replaced a Telegraph link with a Guardian one so I’d have 5 different sources)


Of the two articles that weren’t accompanied by photos of that description, one (the Guardian) was written by a woman, and the other (the Daily Mail) has a whole side bar of crass and exploitative articles about celebs showing off their beach bods or whatever. Sooo I guess what I’m saying is I’m not trying to draw any sweeping conclusions from these observations, they just amused me when I was looking up these articles. ↩︎

        Generating Level Maps for Tone Poem
    
    
    Tone Poem needs to have areas to navigate. Because my primary inspiration for the overall game design is SNES-era console JRPGs, my first impulse was just to follow the lead of games like the venerable Final Fantasy VI. That game had a fair number of caves that looked something like this:

But because it’s intended to be a game that teaches the player some real-world knowledge, it’s anticipated that the player may have to take multiple tries to get through Tone Poem’s areas. So I’d like to pinch the idea of procedural level generation from the roguelike genre and apply it here, to prevent the player from having to slog through the exact same area several times.
If you look again at the map linked above, there’s kind of a lot going on in it. Even ignoring the matter of how doors link up different areas, there are tiers connected only by stairs, bridges connecting an upper tier that can be walked under if you’re on a lower one, switches that have an effect on the layout, and chests placed so as not to block the narrow corridors. And then there are also the purely aesthetic elements like the lanterns and pipes across the ceilings.
It’s certainly possible to generate this kind of thing on the fly, but it seems finicky and not at all fun to me, and the finickiness would only increase as I added more flavorful aspects. Perhaps more importantly, though, the more I thought about it, the more I didn’t want my levels to be like this. One of the least fun things about classic JRPGs is trudging interminably across terrain at a frustratingly slow pace, being interrupted every ten seconds between points A and B to fight annoying pissant dudes when you really just want to get on with it. I want to try to avoid as much of that as I can.
So I want to take a completely different tack with my areas and base them on graphs, in the mathematical sense.  Actually, maybe it would be less ambiguous to say “in the computer science sense” or “in the discrete mathematical sense”, because I’m not talking about the kind of graphs with x and y axes that we all dealt with in math class. I mean the kind that are covered in some detail in the Wikipedia entry for “graph theory” and that are hugely important in things like search engines.
I’ll try to give a sense of how I use graphs to generate maps, and what the advantages and disadvantages of them are, in a future post.

        Music in Tone Poem
    
    
    In my last post about Tone Poem I was struggling with being able to use MIDI files as background music. The main problem was that mingus, the module I was using to read and represent MIDI, didn’t actually work very well for either of those things. Its MIDI file reading was so deficient it was effectively broken, and its model of a composition was too simple to represent even some pretty basic occurrences. In this post I’ll outline a couple more things I tried. Spoiler alert: the first one failed and the second seems to be working.

Independent MIDI Handling in a Separate Thread
The MIDI handler I ended up using, mido, does basic decoding of the inscrutable stream of bytes that makes up a MIDI file. It converts them into Message objects, easily inspectable representations of what the raw bytes actually mean.
mido has a method, play, that applies this conversion to the data in a MIDI file and sends each message in turn to a function of your choosing at the time it would occur if you were listening to the MIDI file normally. Times in MIDI messages are specified in something called “ticks”, and converting those to real time involves some annoying calculation, but mido’s play method handles all that for you. To use it, all I had to do was start a second thread and run play in it, supplying a little boring logic to turn Messages into pyfluidsynth calls.
The trouble came when I tried to sync the thread playing the music with the one where the rest of the game’s logic happens. Beastie attacks, which were supposed to happen in time with the music, sounded off: worse, when I tried to make the music repeat, it did so too soon. In fact, though, I was correctly scheduling it to play every eight seconds. I’m pretty sure its sounding like it restarted too soon actually meant that it was playing too slow relative to Kivy’s scheduling clock.


Doing it Myself With Kivy
If, as it seemed, eight seconds was enough for my MIDI thread to get out of sync with Kivy, the only sure solution I could think of was to clamp the MIDI down more tightly to Kivy’s clock. Fortunately, I had a rough model for how to do that in mido’s play method; unfortunately, because that method used sleep to trigger messages at the right time, it effectively did its own scheduling so it wasn’t simple to substitute Kivy’s. I ended up doing two things I hate: copying code (play), and using bits of mido that were technically private code.
I’ll spare you (any more of) the details, but suffice to say that making this work was probably the hardest thing I’ve yet had to do while making Tone Poem. MIDI timing is idiosyncratic and finicky and I had to do a bunch of things myself that I thought I’d brought mido on to take care of. On the other hand, the end result:

keeps MIDI background music in sync with the events in the main thread
does everything using Kivy’s clock, keeping me from having to coordinate two different scheduling systems
schedules MIDI events on the fly, which should allow me to manipulate them in realtime

That last item means that I should be able to change the key or tempo of background music and have it take effect on the very next MIDI event, which may not be necessary but opens up a few interesting options in the future. It’s not a bad tradeoff for just over a hundred lines of somewhat gnarly code and a couple private API calls, and I’ll probably able to refactor that code to reduce some of the gnarliness. I’m cautiously happy about how it turned out.

        The Prescriptivist&#39;s Dodge
    
    
    A work friend and I were talking about this unfortunate piece of ad copy on Apple’s iOS 8 QuickType web site.

iOS 8 predicts what you’ll likely say next. No matter whom you’re saying it to.

We work in the linguistics group at our company, and among most linguists, prescriptivism is considered kind of a shabby way to look at language. Prescriptivism is basically the stance that one particular way of speaking or writing should be favored over others, and while we can all enjoy a good-natured chortle at Weird Al “fixing” a sign in a grocery store, or the Unnecessary Quotes Blog, it’s both willfully blind to the mutability of language and sometimes very limiting to insist that everything needs to be grammatically “correct” all the time. “Whom” is technically correct here, but it sounds awkward and stilted for a company that likes to keep its products and advertisements approachable and down-to-earth. Using “who” instead might lose Apple points with prescriptivists, but I’d argue that it accomplishes their other goals much more effectively.
But then take this other example, also from the Apple page:

Supported languages include English optimized for the U.S., UK, Canada and Australia; French; German; Italian; Portuguese optimized for Brazil; Spanish; and Thai. And, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese and Japanese Kanji input also continue to feature predictive input.

Despite our best efforts not to wield prescriptivism against every text we see, my co-worker and I thought that “And,” at the beginning of a sentence was clunky. (Note that there is a prescriptivist injunction against starting a sentence with a conjunction like “and” or “although,” but we actually only object to the comma.) Is there a rule against starting a sentence with “and” followed by a comma? I don’t know, actually. But I still think it reads badly.
This leads me to the prescriptivist’s dodge:

Wait, no, I’m sorry. That’s the prescriptivist’s doge. The prescriptivist’s dodge is objecting to language that happens to be against some prescriptive norm, but not because it breaks that norm. No, the non-prescriptivist would never be so rigid and dogmatic! S/he objects only because this particular transgression—I’m sorry, I mean “choice”—sounds bad. Just adhering to the admittedly arbitrary and archaic rules would, coincidentally, in this one particular case, result in something that sounds better.
Of course, “better” is subjective, and a lifetime of being taught that “correct” grammar is super important and seeing “incorrect” grammar and minority dialects associated with ignorance and stupidity will tend to affect your opinion of what sounds “better” without your having much say in the matter. But the prescriptivist’s dodge lets you continue to enforce fundamentally arbitrary norms without being one of those assholes who comments on Facebook posts being all “I believe you meant ‘its’!”
oh my god this page’s URL is totally missing an apostrophe

        MIDI in Python
    
    
    Python prides itself on having “batteries included”, which means it comes with a bunch of well-tested modules that can handle most use cases for a wide variety of common tasks. Some examples:

argparse, for command-line option and argument handling
elementtree, for XML parsing and generation
urllib2, for fetching data from the Web (and elsewhere)

All these helpful and robust modules can spoil programmers and leave them stymied when they run up against a task which isn’t well-supported by the standard library. I bumped into this when I tried to use Python to handle some MIDI.
Briefly, MIDI is a standard format for transmitting musical data. It’s been around for I think two or three decades, but it’s still sufficiently esoteric and its uses rare enough that it was never added to Python’s standard library. As a result, it occupies a kind of tool netherworld: trying to find Python code that handles all the things you can do with MIDI led me into a funhouse with “Unmaintained since 2006” or “Not well-tested” or “Does most of what I need, but” scrawled on every dead-end and shadowy corridor.
After a quick survey of the existing tools, I settled on working with two of them to do mutually exclusive MIDI-related tasks:

rtmidi to handle reading data from a MIDI keyboard in realtime. The version number was worrisome, but it seemed like a simple enough task.
mingus to handle the transformation of MIDI files into musical data structures that can be manipulated using music theory. Again, ominous version number, but it seemed to be fairly robust and actually had unit tests.

This went well until I put together a brief track in Logic Pro and exported it to MIDI; mingus, on trying to read the resulting .mid file, failed with a complaint about a chunk of MIDI data that it couldn’t handle. I did some research into the MIDI file format, looked at mingus’s source code, and determined that while it was possible that there were events in my file that mingus couldn’t handle, the one it actually complained about wasn’t even present. Unfortunately, it seemed that mingus’s unit tests did not have great coverage in the area of MIDI file importing. I did not want to try to fix it myself.
I went out in search of a finer-grained tool. Mingus’s main job, it seems to me, is doing music theory; MIDI handling is ancillary and it shouldn’t have surprised me much that it was poorly tested. I found another library, mido, which handles MIDI without all the music theory, and tried to use it to read my problematic .mid file and pipe the messages into Mingus. I was able to get a “composition” in Mingus this way, but the note durations were screwy. I realized that Mingus’s representation of music data, as a purely linear series of “note containers”, was not really sufficient to represent an arbitrary piece of MIDI music. Even something as simple as having a note sound while the previous one is still ringing is not, as far as I can tell, representable by a Mingus data structure.
I’m reconsidering my choices now. What I absolutely need out of MIDI handling code is the ability to detect and handle basic (note data only) input from a MIDI keyboard, but it actually occurs to me that most other tasks are just nice to have. If I have a soundtrack in MIDI format, I don’t need to be able to read it into a data structure that can recognize and manipulate its music-theoretical properties. I really just need to be able to play it. Basic transposition or tempo changes are things I’d like to have the option of doing (and they would be much more difficult with audio data than with MIDI), but they don’t require sophisticated insight into the data. So I think perhaps I need to consider instead a configuration like this one:

mido for handling all MIDI, be it realtime or file-based. It has a promising version number, for what that’s worth, and has been worked on recently enough that there’s some hope of getting help if I run into trouble with it. I think I can use it to replace rtmidi as well.
mingus for any music-theoretical shenanigans I want to do. Its MIDI handling seems like an afterthought now that I’ve checked it out, and so I’ll probably ignore it completely.
pyfluidsynth for playing MIDI sound. I think it’s included in mingus and it should be safe to use from there. I don’t know how robust it is but I’m pretty sure it’s just a thin wrapper around the quite old and well-tested fluidsynth.

Needless to say, this has all been kind of frustrating, but I think it’s also worth it for forcing me to think a little more precisely what I need to be able to do.

        2013 Music&#39;s Best Lines
    
    
    
“Q: Do you fall so short of all that’s in your heart / When your friends, who you should pull up, you instead pick apart? / Do you watch the world get cold and crushed and small / And when you could do so much, you do fuck all?” –Okkervil River, “All The Time Every Day”

The “Q” is in the lyric, yes (though not sung): this song is a questionnaire; this verse a question and, though a painful one, not an accusation; the answer is the chorus is the song’s title, repeated in various permutations in defiance, in the hope of exculpation, in anticipation of the final verse and its revelation that the singer/interrogator, too, has the same answer and that we should not be ashamed, but neither absolved. All we can do, perhaps, is what the singer does: try, but try we must, all the time, and every day.

“Outside of the influential arms of your idolatries / The object will be turning goodbyes into good biology” –The Uncluded, “Organs”

In a song which flips between tender emotion and ruthless pragmatism, between borderline PSA and animal mysticism, with as much charming awkwardness as it does Kimya Dawson’s childish verses and Aesop Rock’s gravelly verbosity, Aes delivers a couplet that concisely demonstrates the appeal of the whole Uncluded project. The strangely touching but still goofy play on words “goodbyes/good biology” is the icing on the cake.

“This is born alone, die alone / So my dialog’s dastardly / Life’s a tragedy generator operating at max capacity” (El-P); “My pugnacious rhyme patterns prove pit bull in my pedigree / And dogs fight to the death. You say you better? You better be!” (Killer Mike), –Run the Jewels, “Twin Hype Back”

It didn’t seem right to have a line from just one of these two here, so I picked a couple that illustrate the dichotomy making Run the Jewels so compelling. The main mode in which both of these two operate at pretty much all times is aggression, of course: most any thirty second slice of this album or either of their recent solo albums is sufficient to demonstrate that. El-P’s is born out of nihilism; Killer Mike’s out of arrogance or, sometimes, righteousness. El-P “never met a word [he] wouldn’t, like a weapon, just brandish”, and here they unroll out of him like a lash of barbed wire. Killer Mike, meanwhile, wields his like blunt instruments; I don’t even generally like alliteration but here he makes it work for me.

“I’m a tired arachnid spinning loose in my threads, building lifetimes of gossamer beds / And the filigree water drops around my head, they absorb every word that I said / There are no wings hitched to my spine, just an undying urge to climb / And I’ll wait for my mother, supposing she’d bother to hold me and keep me awhile” –Laura Stevenson, “L-DOPA”

L-DOPA, according to Wikipedia, is a chemical used to increase dopamine concentrations in the brain. The song seems to focus on Laura Stevenson’s somewhat fraught and distant relationship with her mother, but it also contains some of the most poignant and beautiful metaphors in any song I heard this year. This is the third of three of those metaphors and my favorite by a very thin margin. I have nothing to say by way of unpacking its meaning. I just think it is some of the most beautiful lyricism of 2013.

“They be shooting whether it’s dark or not / I mean the days is pretty dark a lot / Round here it’s easier to find a gun than it is to find a fucking parking spot” –Chance the Rapper, “Paranoia”

In an extremely obvious “secret” track after the freewheeling “Pusha Man” (who puts a secret song after the second track on an album?), Chance the Rapper brings some old-school Kanye-style frustration with the violence in his home city of Chicago. He’s practically gritting his teeth in this line, conflating his fear of that violence with a frustration that even bougeois-ass white people like myself can relate to, in a way that’s both funny and not.

“The paramedic thinks I’m clever ’cause I play guitar / I think she’s clever ’cause she stops people dying” –Courtney Barnett, “Avant Gardener”

This line is the best from among several good ones on Barnett’s pre-debut Double EP: A Sea of Split Peas. I don’t think it needs a lot of explication. It’s just a great line.

“Pockets stay on swole, peep the motherfucking cash flow / Niggas pay my loans just to finger fuck my asshole” –Cakes Da Killa, “Get Right (Get Wet)”

Cakes Da Killa’s The Eulogy starts with a minute or so of pitched up MacArthur Park and then this line, and it sets the tone for the whole album in terms of campy audacity and graphic sexual forthrightness. It’s almost sure to induce a double take on your first listen and serves as a sort of “Abandon all homophobia, ye who enter here” warning.

“What’s that in your gun holster? / Oh, this? It’s the de-negritizer / I shoot myself with it until I’m whiter than Peter Piper / Now I’ll be able to bow before a world leader’s miter / And tell them the shackles on my Adidas sneakers need to be tighter” –Busdriver, feature on Milo’s “The Gus Haynes Cribbage League”

This is the line that made me sit up straight and pay attention to Busdriver. As with most rap lines, a significant portion of its appeal is in the delivery, and Driver’s captures the exact blend of insouciance, cynicism and sarcasm that I feel this one demands. Plus the internal rhymes and callback to the hook’s Adidas shackle sneaker reference are sick. Sick enough that I don’t care that I’m not 100% sure what the man’s getting at; do white people have to kowtow to world leaders more than black people do? Really? That seems pretty equal-opportunity to me. Anyway, these two bars rule and Busdriver is my favorite rapper of 2013.

        Thoughts on Yeezus
    
    
    Yeezus makes me uncomfortable. I don’t doubt that this is a large part of the reaction Kanye West is trying to provoke. Yeezus is uncomfortable music: all sawblade synths, queasy riffs, samples appearing from nowhere and disappearing just as abruptly. But shit, I fuck with Death Grips and Clipping too. The industrial techno glitch crunk grime beats or whatever are novel for Yeezy and well suited to the aggression he brings to his raps here, but they don’t make me uncomfortable. What makes me uncomfortable is Yeezus’s lack of apparent sense of humor or even self-awareness as Kanye West flings that aggression outwards in all directions. Nowhere is this more jarring or nauseating than when, in “Blood on the Leaves”, Kanye repurposes “Strange Fruit”, a song about lynchings, into yet another screed against women using marriage (or, as he terms it, “unholy matrimony”) to soak men for their money. It’s “Gold Digger” again, except with all the winking and jokes replaced by, in case I haven’t made it clear how fucked up I think this is, a sample from a song that is literally about actual lynchings. Of course there are no jokes, though. Yeezus’s idea of a joke is “I’m In It”’s oft-quoted but still execrable “eating Asian pussy, all I need is sweet and sour sauce.”
Yeezus isn’t all that terrible; in fact, most of my objections concern the lyrics. Musically, it’s everything its admirers say it is: trite as it may be, I have no problem calling it a daring step for Kanye, or a bold and uncompromising album coming from a man who is surely accustomed to having radio play. The only concession to radio-friendliness here is the presence of a few hooks, and even those are simple barked words or phrases as often as not: see the first and last (NSFW probably) songs. Nevertheless, the more I listen to it, the more I think I might end up liking the production here more than on any other Kanye album. Given different subject matter, Blood on the Leaves might have been one of my favorite songs of the year. The brass that comes charging in at intervals is thrilling and foreboding, just one striking element of an instrumental that brings together so many disparate elements that it’s a wonder it works at all. The whole album is kind of like “Monster”, one of my favorite cuts from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, with the alienation and antagonism cranked up even further. Every one of the ten songs here has at least one line that makes me cringe.
In the end, I find Yeezus fascinating as a portrait of an extremely powerful and influential man nonetheless railing against his own powerlessness. “I Am A God” sums this up tidily, starting with its title (which at no point seems to be meant with any degree of irony) and ending with Kanye’s bloodcurdling screams, half terror and half frustration. They’re hardly the screams of someone who really thinks he’s a god, and it’s far more interesting to view his lazy, misogynistic, deadly self-serious lyrics as a façade over the turmoil of the production–one that gets pulled back, briefly and at the moment it seems thickest, for those screams–than to take them at face value. Because for all his power and fame, Kanye can’t stop the armchair psychiatrists of the world (including me) from diagnosing him every time he says what’s on his mind in an interview, can’t smash all the recorders that must hound him every time he’s out in public, can’t force the fashion world to take him seriously by dint of his myriad nigh-unimpeachable musical achievements. Can’t keep his mother from dying.
So in the face of this larger impotence, his lyrics find him still flaunting his wealth, raging about croissants, and of course, debasing and ejaculating in and on as many women as possible. Punching down is a time-honored tradition among people who feel powerless, so it’s not surprising to see Kanye doing it here if you accept the last paragraph’s thesis. But that doesn’t make it any less disappointing.
No one psychoanalyzes Death Grips—who now have four albums and counting suffused with far more schizophrenic paranoia than Yeezus has even in its worst moments—like this. But Death Grips never wrote a “Roses” or “Runaway”, nothing to indicate that their shtick is anything other than just a shtick; they give few interviews and reveal little in them. Kanye’s whole life is a public spectacle, and while he might be playing a character on his albums, part of what makes his music compelling is that his songs seem to be come from an authentic, unfiltered place in him. Their details often match up with what we know of his life, and they have often revealed a complexity that is not much in evidence in the lyrics of Yeezus. I think that’s to its detriment, so I try to read complexity into it elsewhere. To an extent, Mr. West has earned the benefit of the doubt from me. But Yeezus is gross in too many trite and unchallenging ways for him to have earned a spot among my top ten this year.
Thanks to my friend Mary, a couple of whose thoughts in conversation about this album I have probably either knowingly or unknowingly incorporated into this post.

            <content type="html">
    
        Julia Holter, Loud City Song; Yamantaka // Sonic Titan, UZU
    
    
    Sonically, these two albums couldn’t be much more different. Loud City Song is a mellow, generally very quiet and unassuming Julia Holter joint, ecstatically praised by music critics as was its predecessor, last year’s Ekstasis. UZU, on the other hand, is the long-awaited bombastic, diverse debut full-length from the Canadian visual art/music collective Yamantaka // Sonic Titan.
My expectations of how much I’d enjoy them also differed hugely. I didn’t know what to do with Ekstasis and while it was interesting and novel, it never clicked with me at all. (This started to feel like a personal failing on my part when I saw someone compare it to Owen Pallett’s Heartland, my second favorite album of 2010 and probably the one from that year with the most staying power.) But Yamantaka // Sonic Titan’s mini-album YT // ST intrigued me by mixing charming, percussive pop (“Hoshi Neko”) and punishing, endurance-testing hard rock (“A Star Over Pureland”) and managing to stay cohesive, a bit like a more serious, more proggy Deerhoof. I wasn’t always in the mood for YT // ST, but every time I listened to it I liked it more. So I was really looking forward to UZU, whereas Loud City Song I picked up mostly out of curiosity and the hope of redeeming myself for my inability to appreciate Ekstasis.
Well, neither made it into my top 10, but Loud City Song I liked considerably more than its predecessor, and UZU a great deal less, and I’m lumping them together because of one characteristic that they, somewhat amazingly, share: rapping!
I’m using the loose Wikipedia definition of rapping, here—“spoken or chanted rhyming lyrics”—but both albums feature parts that fall in that category quite neatly. The difference goes a surprisingly long way toward explaining my reaction to each album. The rapping on Loud City Song is curious, but of a piece with the rest of the album: still quiet and contemplative, concerned with cocktail parties in the two iterations of “Maxim’s” and the “flavor to the sound of walking” in “In the Green Wild”. It lends the songs in which it appears a focus on rhythm whose lack was, I think, part of what kept me from getting into Ekstasis. I like it. Listen to Ekstasis and the prospect of Julia Holter rapping will seem absurd, but here it feels like a natural extension of Loud City Song’s sound. I still can’t make heads or tails of most of the lyrics, and most of the melodies aren’t strong enough to keep me trying. But the instrumentation is more diverse than on Ekstasis and used well to create atmosphere. Atmospheric music is just not really my thing, I think.
The rapping on UZU is also a fairly natural extension of what’s elsewhere on the album, but unfortunately I find it dreadful. It ruins the track on which it appears for me and causes me to be preoccupied with its dreadfulness every time I think about listening to UZU. I can’t find other reviews complaining about the utter dreadfulness of this rapping, so maybe this is all just my own biases, but I say if you sound like what I imagine Mister Band sounds like, it’s game over.
And it’s a shame, because there’s plenty of other enjoyable stuff on UZU that shouldn’t be overlooked: more slow, quiet songs than on YT // ST, for example, some of them quite affecting. The opening couplet of the last track, “Saturn’s Return”, is sung tenderly despite its ominous content: “Promises made long ago / set fire to the earth below.” That’s an intriguing enough piece of a story that it makes me want to listen to the rest of the album to see if I can find out what those promises were, and the ponderous piano in the backing track is a nice counterweight to the rollicking drums of “Bring Me the Hand of Bloody Benzaiten” and the thick, heavy guitars of “One.” This album’s pretty heavily backloaded, I think, and I like that.
But please save me from that dreadful rapping. I think it is symptomatic of one of the main reasons I don’t like UZU as much as YT // ST: it seems to take itself far more seriously. Too seriously, I feel, for a band that previously recorded “Hoshi Neko” and claims on their label’s page to merge “heavy metal’s brutish assault with Japanese manga’s cartoonish appeal”. UZU has the brutish assault, but none of the cartoonish appeal. It’s not as fun as its predecessor. So it’s not a bad album (aside from that rapping, I cannot emphasize that enough), but it won’t end up on my top 10 list.

            <content type="html">
    
        Woodkid, The Golden Age
    
    
    The musician who records under the name “Woodkid” is a Frenchman whose first full length album The Golden Age is thoroughly lushly orchestrated but doesn’t skimp on the percussion. His beautiful, unique voice has the timbre of a bass clarinet and an accent that sounds, to my ears, not just not French but barely of this world. Over a bed of strings and horns that ebb and swell in all the right ways and drums that boom or clatter as appropriate, he deploys that voice in a way that I can only describe as “bloodless” in the hope of conveying why this album doesn’t resonate with me nearly as much as it seems to want to.
It’s not even that Woodkid’s singing is homogeneous, exactly: as a straightforward example, there’s a clear contrast between the muted verses and the more unrestrained chorus in “Conquest of Spaces”. Even during the latter, though, it still feels like Woodkid is holding back. He never really seems to cut loose and just bellow like I’m pretty sure he can and like the huge arrangements make me want him to; neither does his voice ever deviate much from a sort of emotional equilibrium. As you can hear in “Conquest of Spaces”, it mostly varies only in volume.
So, unfortunately, the closest this album comes to emotional resonance is in the late ballad “Where I Live”: we get a hint of desperation in Woodkid’s raspy voice in the choruses and his near-gasps for breath in between lines. But in the next song and first single “Iron”, he’s back to mostly letting the horns and drums take the reins. Don’t get me wrong, they do it admirably, the horns blaring out a hook that’s three parts martial and one part mournful before dropping into a dark percussion groove. The instrumentation on this album is epic, and I mean that in the sense that it was meant before people on the Internet started using it to talk about their grilled cheese sandwiches and shit: if at least one of these songs don’t appear on a movie soundtrack inside of two years, I will be shocked. Listen to the first twenty seconds of “The Great Escape” if you want to hear the kind of thing I’m talking about.
I think the convincing filmic atmosphere of this album is is the key to the other reason it doesn’t hit home with me, though: there are few examples of its seeming to take many risks. In retrospect I alluded to this in the opening paragraph: every aspect of these songs, from the fist pumpers to the ballads, seems to fall along well-trod paths. It’s hard to qualify this feeling, but the paucity of emotion combined with the nagging impression that any given thirty-second excerpt was created for maximal soundtrack uptake makes these songs feel assembled rather than created.
It’s unfortunate that The Golden Age doesn’t resonate with me, because if it did it’s so well executed that it’d probably be one of my favorite albums of the year. But in the end, I don’t feel much when I listen to it: some admiration, maybe, for the craft. But that’s not enough.

            <title>An Amendment to an Android Widget Tutorial</title>
            <link rel="alternate" href="http://ian.mccowan.space/2013/11/09/Android_Widget_Tutorial_Amendment/" type="text/html" />
            <id>http://ian.mccowan.space/2013/11/09/Android_Widget_Tutorial_Amendment/</id>
            <updated>2013-11-09T05:20:00Z</updated>
            
            
            <content type="html">
    
        An Amendment to an Android Widget Tutorial
    
    
    I’m trying to make an Android widget, and Google turned up a pretty straightforward and well-presented tutorial that I decided to follow to get a feel for things.
The tutorial was fairly easy to follow aside from the text boxes that were too narrow for the code samples, but it had some bits that were either out of date or, more likely, just wrong. So without further ado, I present some errata:

In step 4, you edit the widget’s main.xml file, which the tutorial doesn’t explain should be located in res/layout in your project. Most of it works, but:

The android:id attribute of the LinearLayout tag is wrong, which is unfortunate. The tutorial mentions in step 3 that Eclipse will complain about R.id.widget_textview and that it will be created shortly. It also mentions in step 4 that “the important thing is the id of our TextView, which we used earlier in the WatchWidget class.” But then it still gets it wrong. Oh well. The value of the android:id attribute should actually be &#34;@+id/widget_textview.
I’m fairly certain the widget background stuff is out of date. The background given is a single image, but the link to the Android docs take you to a page where the only available download is a whole folder of stuff. I don’t know how to use the single image provided, so I used the download instead. It contains a res folder with a bunch of folders starting with drawable in it. Their names were similar to those in my Android project’s res directory, so I copied the icons generated by ADT when I set up my project into the downloaded drawable folders and then copied them wholesale into my project, replacing the ones that already existed.
If you use the downloaded resources from the Android docs like I did, you have to change the android:background attribute of the LinearLayout tag of main.xml to @drawable/appwidget_bg. Without knowing too much about it, I believe the downloaded folder contains different resources for different screen sizes. This seems to be the relevant part of the Android docs.

Step 5 has you edit AndroidManifest.xml. But it refers to a receiver named WatchWidgetActivity, which doesn’t exist because in step 1 you unchecked “Create Activity”. It should instead refer to your AppWidgetProvider subclass. So change .WatchWidgetActivity to WatchWidget.
I think it’s a minor issue, but in step 4, Eclipse will complain about your setting the attribute android:text to a string literal. It should instead point to a string resource, because this aids greatly in localization. So to fix the warning, change the value of android:text to (say) @string/test_time. Then open the file res/values/strings.xml and add a new String resource whose name should be test_time. Its value can be whatever you want.
In step 6, android:updatePeriodMillis is set to 1000. Having any widget refresh once every second is probably a terrible idea. I set mine to 600000.

        Cuisine Cascades
    
    
    For a while in high school my mom and I went to an Indian buffet every Sunday, which had good and bad effects on my ability to cook for myself. On the one hand, it taught me about the variety of dishes in Indian cuisine; on the other hand, any Indian meal that lacks that variety now feels incomplete. And I can’t make an entire Indian buffet myself. Not in one night, anyway.
What I can manage in one night is maybe two or three dishes: something time-consuming like chickpeas started in the morning or the previous night in a slow cooker, alongside a quicker dish like matar paneer and maybe something near-trivial like yellow dal cooked the night of. That’s enough of a spread to feel like the real deal, and such is the nature of Indian food that there are usually several days’ worth of leftovers for each.
So that’s when the fun begins, because (often with continued judicious use of the slow cooker) I can then make another dish every night or every other night for a while until I have five or six different dishes available. That’s pretty much a whole buffet’s worth of choices, and if I’m disciplined about eating the older things first, I can ensure that none of it goes to waste by tossing the remnants in the freezer when the selection tapers off. Then I can use those to kickstart things the next time I want to eat a whole bunch of Indian food.

        Does Python Cuddle?
    
    
    In one of my semi-regular Complain About Perl sessions with a coworker, we found ourselves looking at the Perl Style Guide. Something caught my eye almost immediately:

Uncuddled elses.

This is apparently one of Larry Wall’s stylistic preferences for Perl code, which means the creator of Perl is on record as being anti-cuddles, which is just one more reason for me to despise Perl. I was led naturally to wonder whether Python is a pro-cuddle language. But what are cuddled elses? The venerable c2 wiki comes to the rescue:

In an “if-then-else” statement, the following are examples of “cuddled” and “uncuddled” elses in C:


|  /* cuddled &#34;else&#34; */  |  /* uncuddled &#34;else&#34; */   
|  if (x &gt; 0) {          |  if (x &gt; 0) {   
|      x += y;           |      x += y;   
|  } else {              |  }   
|      y += x;           |  else {   
|  }                     |      y +=x;   
                         |  }   

Well, Python doesn’t have braces at all. But thanks to its syntactically significant indentation, its if/else statements more closely resemble the lefthand example than the one on the right. Because of this, I propose that Python can be said to have phantom cuddles for its elses. Rest easy, Python fans. My tergiversation puts Python firmly in the pro-cuddle camp.

        Notes on Haskell
    
    
    I have a fairly deep background in pure math, and Haskell appears to be the purest and mathiest of the many functional languages that are getting more and more fashionable of late. So while one of my close co-workers recently took a course in Scala and my boss has dipped his toes in Erlang, I’ve chosen Haskell for my introduction to the functional language craze. Now we just need two of my other fellow software engineers to delve into OCaml and F# and we’ll have a royal flush.
I’m still a rank amateur at Haskell and am going about it in a completely unsystematic way, but nevertheless I am making progress and wanted to document a couple recent breakthroughs of sorts that I’ve had with it. The first came so easily and elegantly that my eyes turned into hearts and I almost titled this blog post “Haskell is Cheating.” But then the second was a series of battles with foggy comprehension and unfamiliar paradigms that quickly eroded my optimism and then continued until I was nearly sure Haskell and I didn’t have a future.
Eventually I worked it out, though, so now that I’ve bounced back a little I think I should document all this. The two breakthroughs came on Project Euler problems 2 and 3, which is a little embarrassing but I did say I was a rank amateur. Just a little less of one today than I was yesterday.

Problem 2
Problem 2 was a lark. The statement of the problem is:

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:  1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, …  By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Generating Fibonacci numbers comes probably just after Hello World and finding factorials in the Beginner Programming Problems Hall of Fame, and a straightforward recursive solution is easy in Haskell:
fibo 0 = 0
fibo 1 = 1
fibo n = fibo (n - 1) + fibo (n - 2)
But that solution won’t memoize: if you ask it for fibo 156 it calculates fibo 0 through fibo 155, and then if you ask for fibo 157 it calculates them all again on its way.
I came across another solution that took me a little time to understand:
fibs ∷ [Integer]
fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)

fibo ∷ Int → Integer
fibo n = fibs !! n
The first and retrospectively stupidest question I had was how this memoizes any better than the naive solution above, but that is obviously because fibs is an infinite list. Thanks to Haskell’s lazy evaluation, it fills up only as far as we ask it to (using fibo) and stores everything preceding that. Okay.
The definition of fibs puzzled me but not for too long: zipwith combines corresponding elements of two lists using the predicate that it takes as its first argument. So fibs seeds the list of Fibonacci numbers with the first two, then generates subsequent ones by summing corresponding elements of that list and itself sans its first element (tail fibs). To put it another way, you get subsequent entries in fibs by summing what you’ve got so far with the same shifted up by one. Sort of like this:
fibs      0 1 1 2 3 5  8 
tail fibs 1 1 2 3 5 8  13  etc...
sum       1 2 3 5 8 13 21
Anyway, that was fine. What was beautiful, once I had that, was the actual solution to the problem. It looked like this:
sum $ filter even (takeWhile (&lt; 4000000) fibs)
which is about as close as you can get to just restating the problem in code. Read function applications from right to left: take Fibonacci numbers while they’re less than 40 million, filter out the even ones, and sum the result. It’s beautiful. That’s when my eyes turned into hearts.


Problem 3
Unfortunately, then there was Problem 3:

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.  What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?

I’ve done a whole bunch of Euler Project problems in Python, and I found it very helpful to build up a library of useful functions along the way. So I didn’t just want to solve this problem; I wanted to use it as an opportunity to add a factors function, which would take an integer n and return a list of n’s prime factors, to my repertoire. After I did so, the solution to Problem 3 was a joke:
last $ Euler.factors 600851475143
Coming up with factors was the part that gave me problems. Here’s the basic approach that I used and to which my eventual success hewed pretty closely:

Write a divisible function to tell me if one number divides another. (This is just syntactic sugar for n mod m = 0.)
Use divisible to find the first divisor d of n by checking everything between 1 and √n.
Recursively call factors on n / d.

I’m sure this is far from optimal but I believe it’s the approach I used in Python, it worked pretty well there, and it seemed to me that it would work even better in Haskell. Well…
The most difficult thing about this problem actually turned out to be the √n part. Haskell has a built-in square root function for floating point numbers, of course, but unfortunately because of precision issues, just using it and then taking the floor of the result can lead to wrong answers and overflow errors for large enough numbers. I’m making a repository of useful stuff, I want it to be better than that. So I went and swiped some code based on Newton’s Method:
squareRoot ∷ Int → Int
squareRoot n 
    | n ==  1              = 1 
    | otherwise            = div (k + ( div n k)) 2
where k = squareRoot(n-1) 
I implemented everything else and tried it. It worked okay, but when I ran factors on a six-digit number, it took probably ten to fifteen seconds. A back of the envelope calculation then yields about 200 days for the actual problem, assuming the runtime increased linearly, which it almost certainly would not have. Of course that didn’t matter, because when I compiled and ran the same test instead of using GHCi, I got a stack overflow error.
I figured the problem was in my factors definition. Some googling for the error yielded some interesting and, to me, unintuitive results about tail recursion. Sure enough, factors was not tail call recursive; my recursive call did a division and a list append after returning. I floundered about with some attempts to force strict evaluation but they were more or less at random and so of course yielded nothing. Finally I added an accumulating parameter to factors to make it properly tail recursive. The stack overflow persisted.
OK. I decided to try some bigger guns and dip a toe into Haskell profiling. I realize now that that page says heap profiling, whereas I had a stack overflow, which may be why the option that seemed to be necessary for me wasn’t on it. In any case, I did some more random flailing about with command line options that produced useless files before compiling using ghc -prof -auto-all and running with ./problem3 +RTS -p -hy to get something useful: a file named problem3.prof that told me most of my time was actually being spent in squareRoot!
Treachery! That innocuous-looking code I’d pilfered from the web was terrible! And now that I looked at it again, why the hell was it recursing on n - 1? That would seem to mean that calculating the square root of 261,315 would require doing the same for 261,314 other numbers as well!
I scrapped that code and wrote a stupid binary search my damn self, using not one but two accumulating parameters to make sure it was tail-recursive. Here’s the result of my sweat and tears (no blood, I mean Jesus it’s just computer programming):
squareRoot&#39; ∷ Integer → Integer → (Integer, Integer) → Integer
squareRoot&#39; n g (min, max)
    | g^2 &lt; n   = if (g + 1)^2 &gt; n
                      then g
                      else squareRoot&#39; n ((max + g) `div` 2) (g, max)
    | g^2 &gt; n   = squareRoot&#39; n ((min + g) `div` 2) (min, g)
    | otherwise = g

squareRoot n = squareRoot&#39; n (n `div` 2) (0, n)
Needless to say, I’m not nearly as euphoric about this as I was about Problem 2. In fact I kind of hate this code. Accumulating parameters are gross and ugly and they make this function take way too many parameters.
On the plus side, according to the same profiling I’d done before, it appears that my code ran in about 2 μs, which I must admit is a significant improvement on 200 days (if the old slow code was linear) or the lifespan of the universe (if it was exponential). At some point I may go back and see which of my optimizations were necessary, but I think I’m done touching this code for now. Fighting with it was demoralizing at first, but I think it was necessary for me to get a more realistic idea of how Haskell operates.

        Compiling Textual
    
    
    Okay, I’m sure that by the time I need this again it will be defunct in some way because such is the nature of XCode, but nevertheless I’ve done this twice and struggled for way longer than necessary with what I think was more or less the same thing both times. So, for my own reference and that of anyone trying this for themselves, here’s the steps for how I successfully compiled Textual 3.1.0 with XCode 4.6.3. These instructions assume you have XCode and Git installed and some basic familiarity with the command line.

Clone the Textual repo into some directory. I used ~/Code/Textual and did it with the Mac Github app by clicking the “Clone in Desktop” button on the right side of Textual’s Github page.
Check out a released version of Textual. Go to the folder where you checked it out and issue the command git tag -l to list the available tags. Pick one (probably the one with the biggest number, I dunno) and do git checkout tags/&lt;tag&gt; where  is the tag you chose. In this case it was v3.1.0.
Follow steps 3–5 in these instructions.
Open the “Frameworks” folder in your checked out Textual folder. It will have some subfolders in it: five, as of this writing. You care about three of them: “Auto Hyperlinks”, “Blowfish Encryption” and “System Information”. For each of these three, do the following:

Open the folder and then the “Source” subfolder.
Drag the file with the .xcodeproj extension onto the “Main Project (Textual)” project in the Project Navigator in XCode. The Project Navigator is the left-hand sidebar with the little folder icon at the top selected; you may have to left-most button above the “View” control in the toolbar to turn it on. Here’s a screenshot summing up what does where.
Turn off code signing for the resulting (sub?)project in XCode. That means repeat step 5 from the instructions linked in step 3 above.

Follow steps 6–8 in the aforementioned instructions.
The app will be in the Build Results/Release subdirectory of your Textual checkout. Put it in your Applications folder.

        Converting a Module to a Package
    
    
    It’s happened often (well, twice) that I’ve had a Python module that started to get a little too big for its britches: maybe approaching 1000 lines, maybe just including several subclasses which are related but really ought to have their own files. Documentation on the Python packaging system can be a bit daunting. I don’t think I need to use setuptools or distutils or distribute because this module is intended only for the use of me and my team. I just want to organize my code better.
Making a module into a package is an easy way to make it possible to split it into different source files which are all available under the same name. In simple cases, you can do it with zero modification to the code that imports the module. As a very basic example: say you have a module in your PYTHONPATH named parts.py with two classes, Widget and Grommet. You want these two classes to have their own files, but still import them from parts.
First, create a directory named parts in the same location and two files named Widget.py and Grommet.py in it; move the source for each class into the corresponding file. Then create a text file in the parts directory named __init__.py. Edit __init__.py and add the following:
from Widget import Widget
from Grommet import Grommet
This makes Widget and Grommet accessible by using, e.g., from parts import Widget or
import parts
parts.Widget
just as when the two were both in the parts.py file.
If Widget and Grommet have some shared code, you can put that code in a third file, alongside the files for the two classes, and import it into those files normally. Now if you want to, say, add a subclass to Widget, you can do so in Widget.py without cluttering up the Grommet code.

        StringIO
    
    
    I recently discovered the StringIO module and have been using it surprisingly often. It’s not a terribly flashy module, being roughly equivalent to a C++ stringstream, but it is proving useful more than I expected. There are a couple use cases that have come up more than once just in the last couple weeks:

I’m trying to run a command that produces output to stdout and read that output with a function that expects a file. Instead of piping the command’s output to a file, I can just initialize a StringIO with the result of subprocess.check_output() and pass it into the function. Intermediate files suck and I hate them. Using a StringIO, by contrast, is so fresh and so clean, clean.
I’m trying to write unit tests for functions or methods that read things from files. A unit test that depends on a file isn’t very, you know, unit-y. So instead I can keep it all in the test suite by putting the contents of a test file into a StringIO and passing that to the function or method I want to test. Poof, no filthy, error-prone external files sitting around and begriming the purity of my unit tests.

In retrospect, at least the second of these things seems obvious: like it should be a bog-standard way to write unit tests that don’t depend on external resources. But I’ve done a fair amount of cruising StackOverflow and other places looking at Python unit test best practices and haven’t ever stumbled across it before.
