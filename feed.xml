/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the sixth in my series of posts about books I read for Seattle Public Library’s 2019 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spl.org/programs-and-services/learning/summer-of-learning/2019-adult-book-bingo&#34;&gt;Book Bingo&lt;/a&gt;, which ended on September 3rd; I did get a bingo, but neglected to submit the card before the deadline. Whoops! Anyway, for the “by an author of color” square, I read &lt;em&gt;The Fire Next Time&lt;/em&gt;, by James Baldwin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was inspired to read this book by the track “&lt;a href=&#34;https://genius.com/Jamila-woods-baldwin-lyrics&#34;&gt;BALDWIN&lt;/a&gt;” off Jamila Woods’s excellent album &lt;a href=&#34;https://jamilawoodsmusic.bandcamp.com/album/legacy-legacy&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;LEGACY! LEGACY!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://songexploder.net/jamila-woods&#34;&gt;episode of the Song Exploder podcast&lt;/a&gt; where she explained how she wrote it. Woods had an &lt;a href=&#34;https://pitchfork.com/features/song-by-song/jamila-woods-legacy-legacy-interview/&#34;&gt;interview with Pitchfork&lt;/a&gt; which echoed much of her explanation in the Song Exploder ep:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He talks about white people, and how they don’t always see us as human—but he’s saying, These innocent people, we have to accept them with love. The way Baldwin talks about love is so complex, and it’s always an active choice, but that was always the part of the letter where I was like, Really? It seems very difficult to accept all of these people with love. Accept Dante Servin and [George] Zimmerman with love? That’s a lot, James.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book &lt;em&gt;The Fire Next Time&lt;/em&gt; consists of a pair of letters, “My Dungeon Shook: Letter to My Nephew on the One Hundredth Anniversary of the Emancipation” and “Down At The Cross: Letter from a Region in My Mind.” A version of the former, which differs a bit from the one in &lt;em&gt;The Fire Next Time&lt;/em&gt;, can be read &lt;a href=&#34;https://progressive.org/magazine/letter-nephew/&#34;&gt;at the Progressive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had a hard time writing about &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/2018/08/30/No_One_Will_See_Me_Cry/index.html&#34;&gt;No One Will See Me Cry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/2018/08/02/Hybrid_Child/index.html&#34;&gt;Hybrid Child&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; because they were kind of oblique and non-linear, I had no such problem with &lt;em&gt;The Fire Next Time&lt;/em&gt;. Baldwin’s prose is elegant and straightforward, simultaneously merciless in his clear-eyed indictment of white America and merciful in his ultimate refusal to let that indictment become fuel for hatred. This book is challenging to write about in a different way: if there are hidden or subtle meanings to be teased out here, I — as a white man conversant with but not steeped in American racial inequality — am not the best person to do so. So this will be more a personal reaction to what I read than an analysis of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That disclaimer in mind, something that struck me about &lt;em&gt;The Fire Next Time&lt;/em&gt; was how extremely (and refreshingly) not written for a white audience it seemed to be. White mistreatment of black people is axiomatic; Baldwin doesn’t cite statistics or relate anecdotes in an attempt to convince anyone of what he knows to be true. By giving up that defensiveness, he’s able to cover a lot of ground in these hundred or so pages, about the consequences of American racism and what it will take to change it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first letter, “My Dungeon Shook,” which occupies only about ten percent of the book, is explicitly addressed to Baldwin’s nephew. Despite that, it does serve a sort of introductory role for white readers like myself: &lt;em&gt;This is how it is for us as black people in America; I’m trying to save my nephew’s life, so don’t expect me to sugar-coat it.&lt;/em&gt; It’s a bracing and uncomfortable read; ultimately, as well, a hopeful one, but not in a way that will let white readers off the hook. Baldwin doesn’t offer easy solutions or the glib slate-cleaning that many white people seem to hope for. His promise to his nephew is that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we with love shall force our brothers to see themselves as they are, to cease fleeing from reality and begin to change it,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and he must have known, over 50 years ago, what we see now: that this would be an arduous process and white people would by and large be dragged into reality only kicking and screaming&lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;Tangentially related, here in 2019 is &lt;a href=&#34;https://afroculinaria.com/2019/08/09/dear-disgruntled-white-plantation-visitors-sit-down/&#34;&gt;Michael Twitty&lt;/a&gt; responding eloquently to some of that kicking and screaming.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Down at the Cross,” which occupies the vast majority of the book, likewise makes very few concessions to any imagined white reader. Again Baldwin is able to write with great candor about his experience, his knowledge about the treatment of black people in general at the hands of whites, and about the Nation of Islam movement that that treatment gave rise to. When he spells out the prophesy of the white man’s inevitable doom that gives the prophet Elijah Muhammad and his Nation of Islam followers their hope, their influence and their power, we sense that Baldwin is tempted by it. When his retelling of that prophesy culminates in their conclusion that “the sword they have used so long against others can now, without mercy, be used against them,” we sense his hand half-reaching for the hilt. And after he steps back from that tale into his own life — where he once fled a different church, in part, because of a similar bloody-minded division of the world into &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;, the saved, and &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;, the damned — the rest of his meeting with Elijah and his subsequent trip across the city to meet with some white friends feels like a kind of long exhalation of a breath caught in acknowledgement of the power of Elijah’s story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Baldwin is spinning on the impossibility of convincing Elijah that white people don’t, perhaps, deserve wholesale annihilation, he feels a moment of kinship with the conscious white people he’s come to know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the eeriest way possible, I suddenly had a glimpse of what white people must go through at a dinner table when they are trying to prove that Negroes are not subhuman. I had almost said, after all, “Well, take my friend Mary,” and very nearly descended to a catalogue of those virtues that gave Mary the right to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s characteristic of the charity and compassion Baldwin displays throughout &lt;em&gt;The Fire Next Time&lt;/em&gt;, of his empathy and his refusal to let the long and bloody history of white people’s aggression entirely cloud his view of their humanity. One wishes that white people were generally better at reciprocating that empathy; making this book required reading in high school would be a good step along that path, but failing that, it’s never too late to start. I can’t think of a person to whom I wouldn’t recommend this book.&lt;/p&gt;

/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the fifth in my series of posts about books I read for Seattle Public Library’s 2019 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spl.org/programs-and-services/learning/summer-of-learning/2019-adult-book-bingo&#34;&gt;Book Bingo&lt;/a&gt;. For the “by an author from Mexico or Canada” square, I read &lt;em&gt;No One Will See Me Cry&lt;/em&gt;, by Cristina Rivera-Garza, translated to English by Andrew Hurley. Straight up: I had a tough time with this book, and I might have a tough time writing about it. But I’ll see what I can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where to begin with this book? It’s yet another fragmentary, disjointed narrative of the kind I’ve been subjecting myself to a lot these days: it leaps backwards and forwards in time and probably 70% of it is taken up with one or another character telling stories from deep in their past. In the book’s present of 1920, not much happens: a morphine-addicted photographer, Joaquín Buitrago, sees a woman, Matilda Burgos, in an insane asylum that has employed him to photograph the inmates. He realizes that he had photographed her in a bordello back when she was a prostitute and he was in the habit of photographing prostitutes, and becomes obsessed with finding out her story. With some help from the apparently indifferently scrupulous doctor, Eduardo Oligochea, who admitted Matilda, he gains access to Matilda’s history first through her file and eventually through her own telling. They leave the asylum together under unclear circumstances and move into a house together. Joaquín enlists Eduardo’s help again to collect an inheritance dependent on his being free of his morphine addiction, which he is not, in the hopes of being able to support himself and Matilda indefinitely. Matilda leaves him anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than any other book I’ve read for Book Bingo, thinking about &lt;em&gt;No One Will See Me Cry&lt;/em&gt; feels like stretching my brain, like there’s a muscle in my head that I threaten to pull by reaching for threads in this story and trying to pull them together into something cohesive. But after pondering it for a while, if I had to name the central theme of &lt;em&gt;No One Will See Me Cry&lt;/em&gt;, it’s the way that modernization and colonialism — what Dr. Oligochea calls “reason” at the book’s most chilling twist — sweep those not willing or able to fall in line into madness, penury or death at the fringes of “civilized” society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Characters and events allude to the price of progress everywhere in this novel. Matilda Burgos reminisces about vanilla, which her father farmed before his descent into alcoholism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once you take it away from the trees, vanilla turns bitter, did you know that? Now the flower is no longer in the hands of Indians, but under the very watchful eyes of processors and politicians. Those men, they’re white, mestizos, Europeans. … They are men of violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An insane asylum inmate, morphine-addicted, says to Eduardo Oligochea, avatar of modernity, precision, exactitude, as the doctor constructs profiles of his patients:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was saying that I do not believe in the boredom of the future, that [morphine] is the only thing that can save me from the absurd dreams of generals and presidents. I was saying that people like you, doctor, are going to drive this country straight to ruin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful attorney looks on prodigal son Joaquín and muses fatuously:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disenchantment, disillusionment is in vogue these days. Touching upon it is an index of intelligence, the mark of a refined spirit. Without it, the others would not be able to justify progress. Their own. Among certain successful men, losers are beautiful beings, not to mention essential in the complex interactions of modern life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joaquín seems to be the main character of the story, but his role is mostly that of historian, chronicler, archivist, suitable to his profession as a photographer. Several pictures handled throughout the course of the novel bear his initials. But his own history is interesting mostly insofar as it intersects with that of Matilda, the object of his fascination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matilda’s story, when we finally get to it, feels like the real kernel of the novel, despite that we’re given many superficial reasons to doubt it: after her monologue about her father the vanilla farmer, Matilda says “But I’m crazy, Joaquín, so don’t pay me any mind. Don’t believe a word of this.” Dr. Oligochea says of her in his psychiatric report, “She suffers from an eccentric imagination and has a clear tendency to invent stories,” and says to Joaquín, “Don’t tell me you believe her stories are true.” But Joaquín does believe her; through his belief, we have little choice but to do so too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect I’d have had more success understanding this story if I’d known more about Mexican history going in. But still: I looked up the event in Río Blanco in January, 1907 that is alluded to in a few places, including what’s arguably the tragic climax of the main plotline, but never explained. It was a workers’ riot stemming from a strike. The novel’s most mythic figure, the pianist Diamantina Vicario who captivates both Joaquín and Matilda in turn, is a devotee of “the Cause” of revolution, socialism. And though the turmoil in Mexico in the early 20th century happens mostly in the background of the events of &lt;em&gt;No One Will See Me Cry&lt;/em&gt;, it still seems to steer Joaquín and especially Matilda toward tragedy, marginalization and hardship at every turn. One doesn’t need to know the details to get the sense of being ground beneath the wheels of progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the historical context, I wish I’d had more of a sense of the theme I mentioned above when I started this novel. Flipping through it again to make sense of it for this post has been more enjoyable with some idea of how it’s supposed to fit together; it has all the hallmarks of a story that’s less about what happens and more about what those events can be made to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of those hallmarks stand in opposition to a rousing story. There’s a dream-like logic to the events of &lt;em&gt;No One Will See Me Cry&lt;/em&gt;, marked by inexplicable coincidences like the revolutionary Cástulo Rodriguez just kind of… showing up, bleeding, in Matilda Burgos’s room while she’s under the care of her rigidly hygenic uncle. There’s the unexplained lacuna when Joaquín takes Matilda away from the insane asylum: does he sneak her out? Does Dr. Oligochea give permission? There’s the dialogue, full of strange non sequiturs, turns of phrase, and self-contradictions. Matilda says on one page “Really, I don’t remember anything” and on the very next, “I remember everything, absolutely everything.” Other characters say things like “If you had been loved, Eduardo, you would know that it is never fortunate to be loved by a woman” and “All things are possible, Joaquín, except peace. Had you not noticed that?” The men have a collective obsession with “&lt;em&gt;the first woman&lt;/em&gt;,” apparently roughly equivalent to “the one who got away.” Much of this either made no sense to me or seemed eye-rollingly melodramatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all that, though, I think &lt;em&gt;No One Will See Me Cry&lt;/em&gt; was a success for how it sparked my curiosity for the ambient history I never learned and some kind of deeper meaning to this strange and fractured story. I’d recommend it, but I do think I’d have enjoyed it more if I’d known what to look for when I started and I hope I’ve provided that if you decide to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the fourth book in my series of posts about Seattle Public Library’s 2019 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spl.org/programs-and-services/learning/summer-of-learning/2019-adult-book-bingo&#34;&gt;Book Bingo&lt;/a&gt;. For the “single-word title” square, I read &lt;em&gt;Sisters&lt;/em&gt;, by Lily Tuck. This post will include significant spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sisters&lt;/em&gt; was the first of two books that I read strategically in order to get a bingo with minimum effort, by choosing it from a table in my local library that had a selection of books tagged with bingo square categories. Conveniently, &lt;em&gt;Sisters&lt;/em&gt; is also very short. Ordinarily I don’t favor short books, but for Book Bingo’s official duration (till September 3) I’m on a tight deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short though it may be, &lt;em&gt;Sisters&lt;/em&gt; packs a lot of subtext into its 150 pages. It’s narrated by a second wife who is more or less constantly aware of herself as such, told as a fragmentary but loosely intertwined series of vignettes ranging in length from a few pages down to a single sentence. Those vignettes paint a picture of the main character that’s vivid in some ways and frustratingly hazy in others, though the haziness — and, for that matter, the frustration — seem to be by design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sisters&lt;/em&gt;’ nameless narrator is cagey, difficult for the reader to feel much real affection for. She gives the impression of being unreliable mainly by virtue of what she elides or otherwise obscures: she digresses into academic tangents, relates anecdotes but stops short of telling us why they matter or what they mean to her, and indulges in (seeming) &lt;em&gt;non sequitur&lt;/em&gt; allusions to literature and historical events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most on-the-nose of these allusions, to someone at my level of well-read-ness&lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;“Moderately.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, is tossed off at the beginning of the narrator’s recounting a dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dreamed — not that I went back to Manderley — that I was in a big city like Calcutta or Bombay in India…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the narrator has demonstrated a preoccupation with her husband’s first wife that makes her affinity with the second Mrs. de Winter of &lt;em&gt;Rebecca&lt;/em&gt; quite clear. But unlike Rebecca, whose malign influence that story’s narrator seems unable to escape, &lt;em&gt;Sisters&lt;/em&gt;’s first wife seems just to be trying to mind her own business. The narrator’s obsession with her, whether amusing herself with Fermi questions about how many times “&lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-2&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-2&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;It doesn’t seem possible to discuss this book without mentioning the narrator’s consistent stylistic quirk of referring to the first wife as “&lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt;”, always in italics. I found the seething undercurrent lent by this to be somewhat at odds with the narrator’s actual tone when discussing the first wife, which generally fell somewhere between curiosity and mild intimidation, but given the narrator’s capacity for self-deception that dissonance could certainly have been intentional. It’s also notable that &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; is italicized only as the subject; the narrator never refers to her as “&lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and her ex-husband “fucked” or going out of her way to grocery shop in her neighborhood, hoping to run into her, seems entirely self-inflicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an early apparent &lt;em&gt;non sequitur&lt;/em&gt;, the narrator compares the first wife’s “Grecian nose” to that of Michaelangelo’s &lt;em&gt;David&lt;/em&gt; and then somewhat incongruously tells us the precise height and weight of &lt;em&gt;David&lt;/em&gt;, both of which are considerable. Revisiting the novel in order to write this post, I realized these trivia are a cheeky reference to the actual way the first wife looms over the narrator’s life and the gravity she exerts on the narrator’s thoughts. But it’s not clear whether the narrator herself is aware of this or whether she retreats into statistics as a distraction — and, if the latter, it’s also an open question whom she’s trying to distract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect there are many such instances of the narrator of &lt;em&gt;Sisters&lt;/em&gt; revealing more than she intends in her dramatic changes of subject or her retreats into irrelevant details. The problem is that I don’t particularly care to find them, because I don’t particularly care about these characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot of &lt;em&gt;Sisters&lt;/em&gt;, such as it is, hangs on the narrator’s relationship with the family she married into, with some spicy will-they-or-won’t-they-or-did-or-didn’t-they questions of infidelity to add a little intrigue. But the fill-in-the-blanks plot mainly serves to highlight the narrator’s preoccupations and insecurity. The few candid looks we get at her interactions with her husband don’t encourage us to view the marriage itself as particularly special or worth preserving, and the scenes where we see her with her stepchildren can mostly be characterized as “cordial.” And the narrator herself engages in so much diversion and throws up so many smokescreens that it’s hard to get enough of a handle on her to care very deeply about her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book’s title refers to the quote in its preamble, “First and second wives are like sisters.” There are ways in which its narrator relates to her husband’s first wife as one might a sister: as a rival, an intimidating presence, an object of envy and admiration. But she doesn’t seem to be able to find it in herself to relate to her as a &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt;. In the wake of the divorce that concludes the book — which by that point comes as no great surprise — the narrator declares her intent to reach out to her once more, in a way that perhaps better acknowledges her humanity and may start to put them on more of an equal footing. One can hope that the title will be realized in a meaningful friendship as well. But we don’t get to see the outcome of this phone call, so it’s up to us to weigh the narrator’s capacity for self-deception against our own belief in her capacity for growth, and decide.&lt;/p&gt;

/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the third book in my series of posts about Seattle Public Library’s 2019 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spl.org/programs-and-services/learning/summer-of-learning/2019-adult-book-bingo&#34;&gt;Book Bingo&lt;/a&gt;. For the “book about disability” square, I read &lt;em&gt;My Age of Anxiety&lt;/em&gt;, by Scott Stossel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is anxiety a “disability?” It’s impossible to read this book and come away thinking the answer is categorically “no.” The anxiety Stossel describes is all-consuming, incapacitating, reason-destroying. One of his stated goals in writing &lt;em&gt;My Age of Anxiety&lt;/em&gt; was to better understand the nature of his affliction, and thereby better cope with it. On the evidence of what’s between the covers of the book, it didn’t work. In several places Stossel recounts feeling himself start to be consumed by anxiety and trying to fend it off with his knowledge of the underlying neurochemistry or the long history of fellow eminent sufferers of his condition, only to watch himself crumble under the sway of his hyperactive amygdala all the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Stossel’s knowledge of anxiety that I alluded to in the last paragraph is considerable. Somewhat unusally for the kinds of books I usually read, &lt;em&gt;My Age of Anxiety&lt;/em&gt; has 40 pages of citations and bibliography, and an index. Its scope is broad, spanning hundreds of years of historical perspectives on anxiety across multiple disciplines: psychology, neuroscience, sociology, philosophy and evolutionary biology, among others, all have their say. The only axes along which I noticed a pretty narrow focus were those of culture and geography: Stossel mentions a study here and there which compares anxiety between different populations, but for the most part the book focuses on the white Anglo-Saxon world, somewhat to its detriment. I would have liked more about how anxiety manifests and is studied and perceived in other cultures, and less minutiae about the various abstruse synaptic chemical reactions and particular genes that give rise to or inhibit anxiety. Stossel is an entertaining and good-humored writer, but he couldn’t totally keep this material from being dry in places. With scant background knowledge of or interest in neuroscience or genetics, I have little patience for passages such as “The first gene, known as &lt;em&gt;COMT&lt;/em&gt;, is found on chromosome 22 and encodes the production of an enzyme (catechol-O-methyltransferase) that breaks down dopamine in the prefrontal cortex of the brain,” and this book is littered with such disconnected, jargon-heavy factoids that leave my brain the minute I finish reading them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Age of Anxiety&lt;/em&gt; can get pretty textbooky. But Stossel sprinkles it with personal context or anecdotes that often humanize the academic bits while also letting his personality and sense of humor shine through a little more. The anecdotes include several of what are, it must be assumed, some of his most dramatic encounters with anxiety and panic. They are vicariously mortifying and often excruciating even to read, and they lend a convincing sense of urgency to what must have been a pretty intense search for understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have quibbles about the weight given to different perspectives and topics in &lt;em&gt;My Age of Anxiety&lt;/em&gt;. Besides the aforementioned eye-glazingly dense passages and scant acknowledgement of different cultures, mentioned above, I wanted less about Freud’s more archaic nonsense, less about genetics, and more about anxiety from a modern therapeutic or psychological perspective — more, in short, from Stossel’s current and former therapists Drs. W. and L. Both seem to take the optimistic view of neural plasticity and assert we can rewire our own brains even in adulthood and even without the drugs on which Stossel spills quite a lot of ink. Part of this, admittedly, is probably because my family has its own history of dysfunctionality that I don’t want to be genetically beholden to and am working to subvert. I crave that message of self-determination. But I also felt like the up-to-date psychological perspective on emotional regulation got short shrift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That aside, I’d still recommend this book; it’s very readable and even sort of grimly hilarious at times, and chock full of information about anxiety throughout history and through lots of different lenses. Just be clear, going into it, that it’s mainly a historical treatment of the topic, not a survey of current thought. I think the book jacket is pretty clear on that, but it’s possible I got a little lost in my own hope for what I might be able to get out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;addendum&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Addendum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of erstwhile writer David Foster Wallace (RIP), who’s mentioned twice in &lt;em&gt;My Age Of Anxiety&lt;/em&gt;, and Scott Stossel’s descriptions of the self-reflexive nature of social anxiety reminded me very strongly of DFW’s writings on the same or similar topics. Compare for example this passage from &lt;em&gt;My Age of Anxiety&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terrible irony of social phobia is that one of the things people suffering from it fear most is having their anxiety exposed — which is precisely what the symptoms of this anxiety serve to do. Social phobics worry that their interpersonal awkwardness or the physical manifestations of anxiety — their blushing and shaking and stammering and sweating — will somehow reveal them to be weak or incompetent. So they get nervous, and then they stammer or blush, which makes them more nervous, which makes them stammer or blush more, which propels them into a vicious cycle of increasing anxiety and deteriorating performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with this, DFW’s description of a character, David Cusk, with deathly anxiety about public sweating, from his posthumous &lt;em&gt;The Pale King&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For there were, by this time, degrees and gradations of public sweating, from a light varnish all the way up to a shattering, uncontrollable, and totally visible and creepy sweat. The worst thing was that one degree could lead to the next if he worried about it too much, if he was too afraid that a slight sweat would get worse and tried too hard to control or avoid it. The fear of it could bring it on. He did not truly begin to suffer until he understood this fact, an understanding he came to slowly at first and then all of an awful sudden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comparisons between Stossel’s and DFW’s descriptions of anxiety don’t end there. Both Stossel (in describing his emetophobia, or fear of vomiting) and Cusk are aware of the absurdity of their phobia and totally uncomforted by that absurdity. That awareness of the absurdity also leads both Stossel and DFW to go to great lengths to convey the inner workings of a person experiencing an anxiety-induced panic attack, and the similarities between their descriptions are enough to make it pretty clear that it wasn’t the breadth of DFW’s imagination that enabled him to write about anxiety so vividly.&lt;/p&gt;

/&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second in a series of posts about books I read for Seattle Public Library’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spl.org/programs-and-services/learning/summer-of-learning/2019-adult-book-bingo&#34;&gt;Book Bingo&lt;/a&gt;. For the “Challenges your world view” square, I read &lt;em&gt;The Beatrix Gates&lt;/em&gt;, by Rachel Pollack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content warning: &lt;em&gt;The Beatrix Gates&lt;/em&gt; is very heavy on issues of transgender identity. That’s not the content warning, hold your horses. The content warning is that I’m a cis man and I’m going to write about transgender issues in the process of discussing this book. I’m 100% supportive of the right of everyone to live as their chosen gender or to reject the gender binary entirely, so I’m not going to be coming in hot with some bigoted shit here, and I think my understanding of how to talk about gender stuff respectfully is reasonably solid. But I’m still cis and I haven’t lived it; I may slip up, and even if I don’t, probably any thoughts I have will be &lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/assets/images/posts/The_Beatrix_Gates/talking_about_gender.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;bytebox&#34;&gt; 101-level &lt;/a&gt; and it’s best to consider my audience to be other cis people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically the book I read is titled “&lt;em&gt;The Beatrix Gates, Plus…&lt;/em&gt;” as it contains the title story and two others, as well as a nonfiction personal essay, &lt;em&gt;Trans Central Station&lt;/em&gt;, and an interview with the author. But I want to talk about the title story first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main exposure to trans people has been on the social network Mastodon, which is a relatively accepting internet space and so attracted lots of folks who wanted to get away from all the Nazis that Twitter happily embraces telling them they ought to be holocausted or whatever Nazis like to say these days. &lt;em&gt;The Beatrix Gates&lt;/em&gt; has a vibe that I’ve seen from some people on Mastodon and which I can only describe, approvingly, as “trans supremacy.”&lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;I know that, especially with all the aforementioned Nazis that seem to be around these days, “supremacy” is a loaded term. But I don’t think “trans supremacy” is a problem like white supremacy is, for basically the same reason that I don’t think “punching up” is a problem in comedy. In fact I think it’s a great thing for marginalized people not to settle for the scraps the majority is willing to throw to them, or for merely being regarded as human in the way that the majority takes for granted, but to recast the things they’re marginalized for as strengths and celebrate them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The running theme of trans supremacy, which I should re-emphasize that I made up, is that trans people confront and seize control of their own biology— even if they don’t medically transition — in a way that cis people generally don’t even contemplate. I’ve generally been ambivalent about my gender — American masculinity has a whole lot of problems I don’t want to cozy up to — but still, while reading Mastodon recently, I was struck by the realization that at the age of 36 I’d never asked myself: &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; I actually a man? I’m pretty sure the answer is yes, but the point is how long it took me to ask. Trans people can’t live on gender autopilot in the way that I did for most of my life. They have to wrestle with the question of how to live authentically in the bodies they were born with, or change those bodies to better align with how they feel. I’ve seen trans people on Mastodon who seem to have struggled with that and, at least somewhat, overcome it, and it seems like that struggle made them more comfortable in their skin than most cis people I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Trans Central Station&lt;/em&gt;, Rachel Pollack devotes a couple of pages to looking at how the meaning of the prefix “trans-” pertains to transgender experience in some other words in which it appears: transport, transparent, transmission, and so on. But one she leaves out, and which seems most relevant to &lt;em&gt;The Beatrix Gates&lt;/em&gt;, is &lt;em&gt;transcendence&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Beatrix Gates&lt;/em&gt; asks: if trans people are able to transcend their assigned gender, what else might they be able to transcend? It answers: how about &lt;em&gt;mortality?&lt;/em&gt; This passage, which encapsulates my idea of trans supremacy as well as any I’ve seen, explains how this came to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nons—the non-transsexuals… wanted their nan-o-ma-chines &lt;em&gt;[sic]&lt;/em&gt; to make them &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;, to cure their sicknesses and keep them young, and make everyone pretty, but not &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;. They didn’t want to stop being who they were, or thought they were, to become seriously new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That notion of embracing technology to become something new seems to draw a lot of trans people to cyberpunk, which although it’s usually dystopian is also incredibly rich with possibility for body modification. But &lt;em&gt;The Beatrix Gates&lt;/em&gt; isn’t a cyberpunk story; instead, its central story of how its trans people achieved immortality takes up about half its length and is told as a sort of fairy tale or parable. This, along with a looser theme of mortality, seems to be the thread that unites &lt;em&gt;Gates&lt;/em&gt; and the two other stories that make up this micro-compilation. &lt;em&gt;The Woman Who Didn’t Come Back&lt;/em&gt; is fully framed as a myth explaining how women had and then lost a kind of immortality, or at least a second life. &lt;em&gt;Burning Beard&lt;/em&gt; is a retelling of the Biblical story of Joseph, at the end of his life and remembering how his divine visions have shaped it. They’re fine enough stories but I didn’t get a lot out of them. As well, Pollack’s apparently longstanding expertise in shamanism and the Tarot which she discusses in &lt;em&gt;Trans Central Station&lt;/em&gt; didn’t really have an impact on me; her somewhat brief and superficial treatment of it made me feel like there was background knowledge I needed to have in order to understand its import.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think the real draw here is Rachel Pollack’s thoughts about what it means to be transgender in &lt;em&gt;The Beatrix Gates&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Trans Central Station&lt;/em&gt;. She acknowledges the struggle to be recognized and accepted but presents being trans as much more than that struggle; she reflects on history but, through science fiction, gives us powerful visions of a future as well. This book is a quick read, and I’d recommend it to just about anyone, but particularly to cis people open to a different perspective on engaging with gender. I couldn’t find a way to fit it into the above, but I’ll leave you with this quote, which struck me the most as a cis person:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the wrong language, one of strict categories and confinement, the world becomes a fake, a stage set whose actors don’t know they are in a play… Most people do not notice this becaue their own sense of self, of language, more or less fits the received version of existence. They still suffer, for in a world of strict and very limited categories they must constantly check themselves against the model of a “real man” or a “real woman.” The ones who reveal the fake are the ones who simply cannot make themselves fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

            <summary type="html">This is the first in what will, I hope, be a series of at least 4 entries in this blog about books I read for Seattle Public Library’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spl.org/programs-and-services/learning/summer-of-learning/2019-adult-book-bingo&#34;&gt;Book Bingo&lt;/a&gt;.</summary>
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is the first in what will, I hope, be a series of at least 4 entries in this blog about books I read for Seattle Public Library’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spl.org/programs-and-services/learning/summer-of-learning/2019-adult-book-bingo&#34;&gt;Book Bingo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;marginnote&#34;&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/assets/images/posts/Hybrid_Child/hybrid_child.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;bytebox&#34;&gt; &lt;img

  /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hybrid Child&lt;/em&gt; is by Mariko Ōhara and was originally written in Japanese; I read what I believe is the only English version, translated by Jodie Beck. I picked it up from the library before I noticed Book Bingo was happening, so I was about 150 pages in before I checked and found that the only spot I want to put it in is “Fiction.” That’s an easy one to fill so early, to be sure, but I read plenty of fiction; the point of this for me is to read some things in less familiar categories. So this will hopefully help push me in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For being in an “easy” category for me, though, this was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a particularly easy book to read. Its disjointed and difficult-to-follow narrative has a lot of very sensuously described gore, violence, and decay as well as an even-more-unpleasant-than-average rape scene and pervasive underlying themes of corporeality and mommy issues (a term that I don’t use lightly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main character and titular hybrid child Sample B #3, we learn relatively early on, is an effectively immortal nuclear fusion-powered escaped military weapon who, by consuming part of a living or dead organism, can absorb that organism’s memories and also change shape to mimic it. In the first of the book’s two shorter early sections, Sample B #3 takes a nibble off the corpse of Jonah, a girl who was starved to death and uploaded into a household computer by her insane novelist mother, whilst trying to evade the military unit trying to recapture it. In the second section, again trying to evade the military, Sample B #3 takes a couple-hundred-year vacation into space. When we meet her again, she’s spent so much time “as” Jonah that she’s effectively &lt;em&gt;become&lt;/em&gt; Jonah and is referred to as such for the remaining three-quarters of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that point on, &lt;em&gt;Hybrid Child&lt;/em&gt; reads like its plot is mostly there as a framework, and the imaginative characters seem bound together more by thematic material than by an actual coherent event-driven narrative. There’s some kind of interstellar war between humans and a race of machines called the Adiaptron, but the main events of the story take place on a planet called Caritas far from the front lines and none of the main characters seem terribly interested in the outcome… aside from the intermittently nearly-incorporeal ultimate strategist admiral guy who is born an 800-year-old man&lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;Yes, the birth is described in gruesome, harrowing detail.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; destined to lead humanity to victory in the aforementioned war and lives his life backwards in time, though really this all seems contrived mainly so that he can meet his mother and tell her in advance that she’s going to give birth to him. Just a heads up! There’s Shiverer Mouse, a poor fellow with a degenerative neural disorder who becomes Jonah’s first friend on her return from space and who lives in an ambulatory coffin provided for him by Caritas’s caretaker AI, Milagros, before she started malfunctioning and killing all the inhabitants she used to care for. And there’s his friend Lesiah, a member of a very ambiguously described church&lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-2&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-2&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neon Genesis Evangelion&lt;/em&gt; recently landed on Netflix so everyone is talking about it, and &lt;em&gt;Hybrid Child&lt;/em&gt;’s superficial and largely aesthetic treatment of vaguely Western-seeming religious material pinged my memories of watching &lt;em&gt;NGE&lt;/em&gt; back in college pretty hard.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; whose principal deity might be the same entity that lends that 800-year-old military strategist’s life some kind of meaning besides war when he glimpses her in a sort of waking dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with — and probably partly because of — the plot that never really comes together, the preponderance of themes and motifs that seem like the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; point of the book never quite gelled into a solid takeaway for me either. One thing is certain: this book has a very troubled relationship with maternity. It expresses that relationship via a convoluted series of events that fold back on each other recursively: Sample B #3, as Jonah, the girl who became her mother’s caretaker as a household AI after being starved to death at that mother’s hands, gives birth (via fission) to a “dragon cosmos,” the interstellar organism inside of which she spends all that time in space, and which then delivers her in turn back on Caritas. Later, Jonah destroys her dragon cosmos daughter/mother in a fit of rage and gorges herself on the corpse&lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-3&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-3&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;Her resulting transformation leads to a fair amount of really uncritically presented fatphobia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;; this seems to be the event that tips Milagros, the maternal caretaker of all Caritas, over the edge from erratic benevolence into homicidal neglect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see the central cycle repeating itself in various forms here, but aside from admiring the clever way the author achieved this (and grimacing at much of how it’s described), it didn’t really resonate with me. And the ending, which resolves everything quite abruptly and in an emptily tidy way, didn’t do anything to illuminate what it’s all really &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt;. A couple of other analyses that I read, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tor.com/2019/02/28/quiltbag-speculative-classics-hybrid-child-by-mariko-ohara/&#34;&gt;one by Bogi Takács from a QUILTBAG+ perspective&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://strangehorizons.com/non-fiction/reviews/hybrid-child-by-mariko-ohara/&#34;&gt;one by Rachel Hill that takes a deeper and more traditionally literary look&lt;/a&gt;, do a much better job than I at teasing apart some of the novel’s themes, but still don’t really draw out an answer to what I guess is the main question I’m left with: &lt;em&gt;what was I supposed to have learned from this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hill’s essay takes a somewhat half-hearted shot at answering this question in its last few paragraphs, but I found it unconvincing. The excerpt she cites as an example of the sort of moral of &lt;em&gt;Hybrid Child&lt;/em&gt; reads like it was clipped from a new-age self-help book on its own:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love was the power of abstraction. It inspired two beings to walk to the same beat and to move closer together. The effect of that power went beyond time, beyond each of their individual attributes, and beyond race or species—like a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but even in the context of the story it doesn’t fare much better. I suppose my experience may have been attenuated by my sort of reading much of the book through my fingers, but the relationships between the main characters never really seemed to fit that description. The most appropriate part is “like a miracle,” which accurately sums up the ending, but none of the redemption in that miraculous ending really feels earned by the book’s previous events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I found &lt;em&gt;Hybrid Child&lt;/em&gt; a frustrating read. Despite the disjointed narrative and bewilderingly unfamiliar setting, the plot hung together all right, and I was able to follow it on a surface level far more easily than I expected. But it was still too jumbled to be &lt;em&gt;gripping&lt;/em&gt;; I needed more of an emotional experience or beautiful prose or something to really bring it together for me, and the repeated hammering on the same themes made for a fun kind of treasure hunt but didn’t ultimately resonate with me or coalesce into some kind of payoff. It’s undoubtedly a very creative and imaginative work of sci-fi, but the gratuitous material made it very tough to read in places and all the more unsatisfying when whatever larger message it was supposed to be in service of landed with such a thud.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently participated in a collaboration set up on Mastodon by a mysterious entity known only as “&lt;a href=&#34;https://awhaleslantern.bandcamp.com/&#34;&gt;A Whale’s Lantern&lt;/a&gt;” or “The Whale” for short, who paired me with a total stranger so that I could work with them to write and record a song fitting a Whale-selected theme. This was the fourth such collaboration, but my first. My partner was a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.social/@estebanm&#34;&gt;drummer and songwriter named Esteban&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme of the collaboration was “Portraits,” which made both Esteban and me think about The Cure’s classic “Pictures of You.” But I was afraid that trying to use that song as inspiration would end up with our basically rewriting a worse version of it. I’d recently experienced some songwriting success by starting with a pretty personal kernel of an idea and seeing what it grew into, and so I wanted to take a similar tack here if possible. My biggest contribution to the song, ultimately, was the lyric I wrote, so this post is going to focus mostly on that and how it informed and was informed by our musical choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Portraits” theme made me think of some self-portraits my partner had done for coursework in an art school which was enough of a pressure cooker to border on abusive. They did not accurately depict the strain she was under at the time, and it made me start thinking about the other ways in which portraits can be lies. Around the same time, I rediscovered &lt;a href=&#34;https://mobile.twitter.com/nathanfielder/status/620060895209779200?lang=en&#34;&gt;a Tweet&lt;/a&gt; by Nathan Fielder that fit these thoughts pretty well. It became the direct and obvious inspiration for the opening lyric, “I’m thrilled to be here / And all my friends just out of frame are thrilled too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Esteban and I were discussing the musical side of things. We agreed pretty early on that we wanted to try to use some unconventional time signatures. Esteban came up with the idea of a drum beat that’s ambiguously either 5/4 or 4/4 to symbolize the dissonance (no pun intended) between the singer’s façade and their actual emotional state. We decided the verses would be nominally in 4 but with that drumbeat and the bassline sounding like they were in 5 to lend it some instability. Then the chorus would be straightforwardly in 5 and reveal the singer’s true emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 5-vs-4 ambiguity in the verses meant that the verse would have to be grouped into 5 bars of 4 (so it could also be construed as 4 bars of 5) in order for things to line up, which helped to constrain and direct the actual phrasing of the lyrics. And Esteban had provided some chord progressions that he cooked up, so I found myself writing melodies within pretty strict parameters. I usually start songs with the melody, because I find it difficult to make one fit within the constraints of a predetermined harmonic setting, so this was difficult, and I don’t feel any of the melodies are among my best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote lyrics and guitar lines for a verse and a chorus and the transition between them seemed awkward and abrupt. To smooth it out a little, I thought of a pre-chorus with alternating measures of 4/4 and 5/4 with a simple repeating lyric to bring the tension in the verse to the forefront before kind of letting it all out in the chorus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With one verse, pre-chorus and chorus more or less in the bag, I took a fairly long break to finally finish and release &lt;a href=&#34;https://walruspromenade.bandcamp.com/album/about-faces&#34;&gt;an album&lt;/a&gt; that had been in the making for many years. It was close enough to finished that it was getting in the way of my collaborating on the Whale’s Lantern project. That ate up a fair amount of time but I think it was worth it. When I finished it I was able to devote my full attention to the collaboration, which also now served as a good “rebound” project for me to keep my hand in the music making game and avoid resting on my laurels after releasing something big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I came back to the collab, though, I didn’t know where to go from the one verse that we had. I toyed with the idea of expanding on the situation in which our Nathan Fielder analogue from the first verse found himself, but I wasn’t really feeling it. So I went horizontally rather than vertically: instead of diving deeper into the material I already had, I went back to some almost completely different ideas that came up in my original brainstorming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first was the notion of a king sitting for a portrait. It had to take hours, and doesn’t a king have anything better to do? The whole thing just seems very contrived in a way that fits well with the overall concept of artifice in portraiture. In telling the story of our imagined king, I tried to add a couple layers of intrigue to justify the melodramatic sound in the chorus. I’m not sure I succeeded, but I think it hangs together alright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third and final verse I devoted to something more abstract. Sung from the perspective of a vase (who uncharacteristically does not try to hide that it’s a vase) being painted as part of a still life in a nonrepresentational style, it’s the most off-kilter and unstable-sounding of the three verses due to being in 3/4 over the ambiguous 4/4 vs. 5/4 drums mentioned earlier. I think this was conceptually fun, but again I’m not sure I pulled it off; I went the direction I did more because I thought it would be fun and cheeky than because I had a clear idea of what I was trying to say. The melody is the least coherent of the three verses because of how weirdly the overlapping time signatures caused it to interact with the harmonic material we already had, and the lyrics deviate somewhat from the original concept of a narrator desperately trying to hide something. If anything, the vase is more clear-eyed about its situation than either of the two humans in the preceding verses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I think “fun and cheeky” worked out OK. Since I didn’t have any ideas for a last chorus and we were running short on time, I ended the song very abruptly after a final on-the-nose pre-chorus which spells out what, if anything, the point of the song actually is. It’s not a terribly satisfying point, and the music echoes that by denying you the satisfaction of a cathartic chorus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling the veracity of art into question is not a new idea. Since I took some of the inspiration for doing so in this song from the inimitable René Magritte, I decided I might as well nick the title from one of his artworks too. So the song (which since it only “exists” in digital form is not really a “song” as much as a series of electrical impulses on a hard drive, or whatever) is titled “Ceci n’est pas un chanson” in homage to Magritte’s “The Treachery of Images.&lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/assets/images/posts/A_Whales_Lantern/The_Treachery_Of_Images.jpg&#34; title=&#34;fig:&#34; alt=&#34;Image of a painting of a pipe, with “Ceci n’est pas un pipe” in script beneath it.&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;” Alternate title, I suppose: “The Treachery of Sounds.”&lt;/p&gt;

But I did find myself wanting to look back at 2018 when the year turned, so I widened my scope a little bit. Here are some of the most notable things that happened in my life in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;mastodon&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mastodon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018 I finally deleted my Twitter account and created a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/08/mastodon-quick-start-guide/&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; one. It was a little tough to cut the string, and I don’t have any IRL friends on Mastodon, but I still don’t miss Twitter at all. Mastodon is better for my blood pressure: it’s got fewer Nazis, better moderation to handle the ones who do show up, and just generally a more personal and chummy vibe. There’s still a fair amount of irreverent shitposting, but it’s mixed with a good dose of positivity and all-in-this-togetherness and people generally tend to value being considerate and kind to each other. I still waste a lot of time on it, like I did on Twitter, but the time wasted feels a lot healthier. And being surrounded by marginalized people, many of whom were pushed off other platforms or just quit in disgust, is pleasantly disorienting and enlightening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;therapy&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Therapy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;marginnote&#34;&gt; I got really into Dar Williams in high school. After the intervening 20 increasingly irony-laden years, a lot of her stuff seems sort of painfully earnest, but it seems like that wheel is turning around a bit: authenticity unmarred by self-shame is “in” for 2019. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I credit the Dar Williams song &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwrQXI4_mgo&#34;&gt;What Do You Hear In These Sounds&lt;/a&gt; with inoculating me, about 20 years ago, against the stigmatization of therapy. But it took a really long time for me to actually consider it for myself, and then a couple more very foot-draggy years for me to finally take even the very minor step, in mid-December, of seeing an actual therapist in person for a short consultation session. It went &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;, I guess. I’m very guarded and don’t open up to people easily, so the twenty minute session was fairly impersonal and coldly intellectual in a way that I doubt was very indicative of what actual therapy is like. But it was a first step and I’m hoping to be able to continue that momentum by “shopping around” a bit and ultimately actually starting regular therapy in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;homeownership&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Homeownership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a house in June. Actually a condo, because I don’t want to be responsible for the upkeep on a whole house, I think single-family dwellings are a relic of the past in a city growing as fast as Seattle, and I probably couldn’t afford one even if I did want it. Writing a lot about this doesn’t particularly appeal to me so I’m not going to. Suffice to say the process was roughly one part exhilarating to three parts agonizing and stressful. I do think we had some snafus that led to worse-than-normal circumstances and the average ratio of good to bad is probably more like 1:1 in Seattle (and even better in places that aren’t growing so fast). I’m glad it’s over and that I don’t yet have buyer’s remorse after six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;calligraphy&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Calligraphy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;marginnote&#34;&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/assets/images/posts/2018_Retrospective/calligraphy_tags.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;bytebox&#34;&gt; &lt;img

/&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always had a bit of a fascination with both fonts, scripts and handwriting. I spent a summer in high school improving my normal day-to-day handwriting, and higher education in math ensured that I had further daily practice since the abundance of symbols made computerized note-taking nearly impossible at speed. Then my last full-time job exposed me to a nice variety of the world’s languages, and the aesthetic pleasure of the diversity of the world’s scripts was what fascinated me the most. So late last year I finally took up calligraphy with a dip pen. My practice has sometimes been sporadic but I’ve stuck with it for a full year; the “culmination” of the year’s practice was a little set of tags for my Christmas gifts. It’s not too much, but it’s the first work I did intending it to be “presentation quality” and not just an address on a postcard or some bullshit phrases written purely for practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://thepostmansknock.com/&#34;&gt;The Postman’s Knock&lt;/a&gt; has been a great resource for learning some different lettering styles. It’s the kind of website that offers so much for free that I’ll buy some stuff more as a way of thanks than because I really need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;a-bike-crash&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Bike Crash&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I crashed my bike about a week before Thanksgiving, under circumstances that still aren’t 100% clear to me. I’m pretty sure I took a turn a little too fast and since it was a fairly cold and &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; foggy morning, there was a patina of frost on the trail or something that caused me to just go over sideways. The fun thing is that I don’t really remember. I’m &lt;em&gt;pretty&lt;/em&gt; sure the last thing I was doing before I found myself dazed on the ground with a bloody face was rounding a corner. But I apparently also called my partner four times in the immediate aftermath and left approximately the same message each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a mild concussion, according to the urgent care doctor, in addition to the obvious external injuries to my face. (It’s a very good thing I was wearing a helmet.) This was the first time I’d ever had a concussion, and probably my worst bike mishap of all time. For fifteen years of cycling as my main mode of transport, I consider this to be not too bad. I hopped on my bike again as soon as I had a chance to get it into a shop for a safety check, which turned out to be about three weeks later, and while I’m taking corners a little more gingerly since then, it wasn’t a scary enough experience to put me off my chosen lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;cat-losses&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cat Losses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;marginnote&#34;&gt; I wrote a couple songs about and for Einstein. You can listen and download “The Eternally Incomprehensible Thing” and “God Does Not Play Dice” for free on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://ian.mccowan.space/studio/&#34;&gt;studio&lt;/a&gt; page. &lt;a href=&#34;https://walruspromenade.bandcamp.com/releases&#34;&gt;They’re also on Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt; if you would like to pay for them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We lost two cats in 2018, both to cancer. The first was Fiona, a sometimes-sweet, sometimes-ornery little female calico who we got not long after our last long-time cat Einstein died (also, as far as we know, from cancer) just three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We adopted Fiona at the very end of 2015, like, between Christmas and the new year. The cat shelters were all pretty cleaned out and we found her in a Petsmart, where she won us over by mooshing her forehead against our hands when we reached into her cage (an endearing tendency that she maintained for her whole time with us). We were looking for a low-key cat for our tiny apartment and she did fit that bill pretty well, though she was also much more interested in playing than anticipated and particularly skilled in the vertical dimension of the hunt. She was very hot-and-cold with her affection, alternating between curling up in inconspicuous locations to avoid any disturbance — which she would answer with swipes if necessary — and insistently demanding attention &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt;. But she never completely lost her original charming love of a gentle hand to moosh her forehead against, at least until, shortly after we moved, she stopped eating and lost interest in just about everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;marginnote&#34;&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/assets/images/posts/2018_Retrospective/fiona_paws.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;bytebox&#34;&gt; &lt;img

/&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I have led a pretty sheltered life. But nearly nothing in it has been as painful as having a sick cat with no appetite. The feeling of powerlessness as this small creature, who you love and who depends on you utterly, basically wastes away under your care is uniquely agonizing. And when it’s clear that trips to the vet are terrifying for the cat, and the only way to get them to eat is to force-feed them, my partner and I have fortunately been in agreement that euthanasia seems like the most merciful route. (I know that pet euthanasia can be a fraught issue and I have no judgment for people who choose otherwise, especially given the mind-boggling array of miserable circumstances in which pet owners can find themselves.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we had Fiona put down, when it was pretty clear to us that cancer had made her life a constant pain and being consious held no appeal to her anymore. It was still, and will always be, a difficult decision. We don’t know what’s in a cat’s head and they have no way of telling us, so all we can do is glean what we can from their behavior and tell ourselves the stories that comfort us most about the decision we have to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all that, losing Fiona was like a dry run for Gandalf, almost exactly six months later. The circumstances were almost identical: complicating factors (in Fiona’s case, our move; in Gandalf’s, the arrival of a new cat) obscured the symptoms of a cancer that we didn’t get checked out until it took a turn for the worst, not that treating a cat’s cancer is really on the table for us. In both cases the diagnosis followed almost exactly the same route: after the distressing drastic behavioral change, blood and urine labs turned up &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, and then an ultrasound revealed basically the worst-case scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;marginnote&#34;&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/assets/images/posts/2018_Retrospective/gandalf_reach@2x.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;bytebox&#34;&gt; &lt;img

/&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whereas we’d only had Fiona for two and a half years, my partner had had Gandalf for over a decade, since he was two years old. He’d been in my life for the vast majority of that time as well. Unlike Fiona’s sometimes-fractious temperament, Gandalf loved to be around people; he was mild-mannered, so gentle with his claws that you could tussle with him without getting scratched, and daffily affectionate later in life with a purr that grew louder year by year and that we called his “pigeon purr” for its complex mix of percussive rumble and high-pitched pseudo-vocalizations. He was simultaneously easygoing and chock full of personality, quick to find any plastic bags left out (for impishly chewing on), new open cardboard boxes (for sitting in, a classic cat move), or clean laundry (also for sitting purposes). When we moved into our two-story condo, he quickly developed one method of ascending the stairs, from which he did not deviate for the remainder of his too-short life: galumphing all sixteen pounds of himself up them at maximum speed. He loved having his lopsided triangle face scratched so much that he learned how to grab your hand with his claws and pull it back to his face if you stopped before he was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gandalf was the origin of the term “flavor bag,” where after we got a new bag of dry food and emptied it into a tote, we’d cut it open and lay it flat for him to spend fifteen minutes licking the flavor residue off the inside. His last flavor bag, which he enjoyed with as much gusto as we’d ever seen from him, was two weeks before he stopped eating entirely. I won’t belabor his abrupt decline, which was also shockingly similar to Fiona’s, except to say it was especially painful to see in a cat once so uniquely vibrant and friendly. The boy was one of a kind and we will miss him dearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Media and Things I Loved in 2018&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;music&#34; class=&#34;level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Music&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved Mount Eerie’s 2017 album &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pwelverumandsun.bandcamp.com/album/a-crow-looked-at-me&#34;&gt;A Crow Looked At Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; enough to write &lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/2017/04/15/A_Crow_Looked_At_Me/index.html&#34;&gt;a rare blog post&lt;/a&gt; about it. 2018 saw a follow-up and sequel of sorts, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pwelverumandsun.bandcamp.com/album/now-only&#34;&gt;Now Only&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and I loved it no less. If the first half of &lt;em&gt;Crow&lt;/em&gt; was a transmission from the middle of an inferno of grief and the second half a sort of staggering away from it, &lt;em&gt;Now Only&lt;/em&gt; is learning to live with the scars. It’s still a tough listen but less immediate and turmoil-wracked, more brain and less gut, with a wider view of things and song lengths and instrumentation to match. Taken together, &lt;em&gt;ACLAM&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Now Only&lt;/em&gt; stand as one of the more important musical works of the decade for me. It comforted me during my two terrible losses this year to know that Phil Elverum lived through something worse than what I was facing, to have him make gentle mockery of my impulse to isolate myself in my grief in &lt;em&gt;Now Only&lt;/em&gt;’s title track:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember looking around the hospital waiting room,&lt;br /&gt;
full of people all absorbed in their own personal catastrophes,&lt;br /&gt;
all reading books like &lt;em&gt;Being Mortal&lt;/em&gt;, all with that look in their eyes,&lt;br /&gt;
and I remember still feeling like “No,”&lt;br /&gt;
“No one can understand.”&lt;br /&gt;
“No, my devastation is unique.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, to take a turn away from the tragic, Janelle Monáe’s &lt;em&gt;Dirty Computer&lt;/em&gt; was unsurprisingly excellent. As someone initially drawn to the sprawling, eccentric and ambitious if imperfect &lt;em&gt;out there-ness&lt;/em&gt; of her first two LPs, I wasn’t the best audience for her turn to a tighter, more focused pure pop album, but the mid-album run of “Screwed,” “Django Jane,” “Pynk” and “Make Me Feel” in particular is absolutely undeniable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of Montreal, one of Monáe’s collaborators back in the day, released a pretty focused pop album as well after losing me with their hard turn into shambolic kitchen-sink mayhem (and borderline musical blackface) following their masterpiece &lt;em&gt;Hissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer?&lt;/em&gt; 2018’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ofmontreal.bandcamp.com/album/white-is-relic-irrealis-mood&#34;&gt;White is Relic / Irrealis Mood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; might seem like another trial of patience, with its six tracks clocking in at over five minutes each, but think of them as six pairs of two shorter tracks which blend more or less seamlessly into each other: a bit more manageable. “Paranoiac Intervals / Body Dysmorphia” is the first single and the standout for me, a slice of perfect electropop that melts into something more abstract and unsettling, but “Writing the Circles / Orgone Tropics,” which follows it, is a nice slower comedown with some killer one-liners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got back into Future of the Left, the group of extremely loud British folks with the screamiest and most sardonic frontman since… well, his last group Mclusky, in a big way in 2017. Said frontman has his own project Christian Fitness, under which name he released an album called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://christianfitness.bandcamp.com/album/nuance-the-musical&#34;&gt;Nuance, The Musical&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in 2018. It’s a half hour of stuff just slightly too off-kilter (and sung or spoken in too low a register) to work as Future of the Left tracks, and it’s a blast from start to finish. The addition of strings in some of the tracks mix the sound up a bit without too drastically changing a game that never needed to be changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Jean Grae and Quelle Chris’s rap opus &lt;a href=&#34;https://quellechris360.bandcamp.com/album/everythings-fine&#34;&gt;Everything’s Fine&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=&#34;https://daily.bandcamp.com/2018/12/14/bandcamp-best-albums-of-2018-20-1&#34;&gt;Bandcamp’s number 1 album of 2018&lt;/a&gt; and in my opinion the honor is well deserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;other-stuff&#34; class=&#34;level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other Stuff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dream-quest/id870227884&#34;&gt;Dream Quest&lt;/a&gt; is a combination roguelike/deck builder/dungeon crawler with atrociously amateurish art (apparently created by the developer’s daughters, which is endearing) and game design so good that the developer was apparently hired by Blizzard solely because of it. It’s very difficult, but not to the point of being enraging. And it’s addictive, but not excessively so: I played it a lot for maybe a couple months and then put it down possibly forever when I felt I’d accomplished all I cared to. It’s definitely worth $3 on the App Store and almost certainly worth $10 &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/557410/Dream_Quest/&#34;&gt;on Steam&lt;/a&gt; if the App Store isn’t an option for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing with video games, I loved &lt;a href=&#34;https://radicalfishgames.itch.io/crosscode&#34;&gt;CrossCode&lt;/a&gt; for its gameplay and, after about halfway through, its story. (The story is fine for the first half but became really compelling for me at that point.) It’s very well-made: the look and feel are so nice that the possible grindiness is enjoyable, and the puzzles in the dungeons consistently hit that “just hard enough to be satisfying to solve” sweet spot. I’ve heard complaints about the dialogue, in particular the ham-handed accents and verbosity, but it didn’t really bother me. Your mileage may vary, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I read more in 2018 than in the last few years, but between deleting my Goodreads account and having gotten most of what I read from the library, most of it was pretty ephemeral and none of it sticks out in my memory as being astonishingly good (or bad). I did finally make my way through &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;, which I enjoyed intermittently but mostly just sort of swam in. Reading it with a guide helped, as I’d never have unlocked the more puzzle-boxy aspects of it on my own. Ultimately my favorite chapters (or “episodes” as I suppose they’re called) were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Episode 11, “Sirens,” whose rhythmic and lyrical prose most rewarded reading without comprehension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Episode 15, “Eumaeus,” whose meeting of the two protagonists is rendered with surprising, understated gentleness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Episode 16, “Ithaca,” for the same reason and all those described in &lt;a href=&#34;https://slate.com/human-interest/2011/04/joyce-s-ulysses-the-only-chapter-worth-reading.html&#34;&gt;this cute Slate article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t watch much TV, but I watched a little more this year than previously. &lt;em&gt;Steven Universe&lt;/em&gt; continues to be, in my opinion, one of the best things going in any medium, even hamstrung as it is by Cartoon Network’s frankly self-sabotaging airing schedule, or lack thereof: its compassion, worldbuilding and characterization are just as strong as they were when I got into it originally. &lt;em&gt;The Good Place&lt;/em&gt; was a surprise winner: live-action stuff is a tough sell for me because it can just be Too Much emotionally. But it’s been just consistently great, packing gobs of plot into each episode while consistently delivering great gags and interesting, well-acted characters. Just top-notch along every axis that I’m aware of. And the first seasons of &lt;em&gt;Hilda&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;She-Ra and the Princesses of Power&lt;/em&gt; were also very solid, if not revelatory like my two favorites of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I started listening to podcasts more consistently in 2018. My reliable weekly listen has been Daniel Ortberg’s &lt;em&gt;Dear Prudence&lt;/em&gt; podcast — I’ve been a big fan of Daniel’s other projects for many years, and his advice-giving is no less a joy. In between, I’m listening to the whole backlog of Scott Aukerman and Adam Scott’s &lt;em&gt;U Talkin’ U2 2 Me?&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;R U Talkin’ R.E.M. RE: Me?&lt;/em&gt;, half tributes to a couple bands that hold a lot of nostalgia for me and half just two pretty funny guys shooting the shit in a breezily amusing way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;ideas&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ideas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between living with a partner who’s living outside the demands of capitalism as much as possible and sort of existing in/keeping an eye on some more radical spaces, I came across some ideas that seemed novel or made me think about things in a different way. This is necessarily a little vague, and some of these ideas are probably very Systemic Critique 101, but as someone that the current predominant systems have been pretty good to, I haven’t necessarily been pushed to think about these things as much as the places I got them from. None of them are sourced, unfortunately, aside from one quote I’ve seen that’s pertinent. They were sort of osmosed over time rather than picked up atomically from single sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;capitalism-isnt-axiomatic&#34; class=&#34;level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Capitalism Isn’t Axiomatic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;
Ursula K. LeGuin
&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What values arise from treating capitalism as a bedrock assumption in society? A couple have been on my mind this year. The first is the notion of “success” in capitalism. By most widely-accepted measures, to be successful necessarily includes having enough money to sustain yourself, and preferably more. But all this really means, assuming your money was earned with your labor and not inherited or gotten some other way, is that you have a skill that’s valuable under capitalism’s priorities. The thing is, if you look at how effective capitalism’s priorities have been in addressing, say, climate change, arguably the most pressing issue facing humanity in modern times, it’s clear that they’re not actually very well-ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other notions also seem less solid if you don’t accept capitalism’s priorities at face value, like that of “disability.” Some disabilities start to seem like &lt;em&gt;dissonance&lt;/em&gt; with the structure of a society set up to satisfy capitalism’s demands, rather than inherent impediments to a fulfilling life. Indeed, the term “disorder” suggests this reading: not a &lt;em&gt;deficiency&lt;/em&gt; as the term “disability” is often understood, but a difficulty fitting with the prevailing order. I think it’s possible to imagine a differently ordered society, for example, that doesn’t expect the majority of people to submit to strictly regimented schooling and then do more or less the same thing for 8 hours a day or more in order to continue to live, where “Attention Deficit Disorder” isn’t something that needs to be treated intensively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weirdly, the event that precipitated my thinking about this wasn’t reading the quote above, but seeing an episode of &lt;em&gt;My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic&lt;/em&gt; that my partner was watching. It centered around a competition between a small, pony family-owned cider business and the out-of-town hotshots trying to use automation to subsume or extinguish them. Despite that the show takes place in a wholly imagined animated universe whose inhabitants are all anthropomorphic quadrupeds, and where &lt;em&gt;friendship is, literally, magic&lt;/em&gt;, they still seem to operate in some kind of capitalist system. I get that the show operates at least partially via analogue to the real world, but it’s still kind of weird that in a world where literally everything is made up, these magical ponies still have to worry about paying the bills (at least when it’s convenient for a plot arc). There’s still, apparently, an economic system in place that threatens a family with losing their farm if they can’t make enough profit. This doesn’t seem like it has to be a given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I don’t have a fully formed better alternative to capitalism. But I think &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/03/socialism-as-a-set-of-principles&#34;&gt;we can move toward one&lt;/a&gt; incrementally.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;personal-property-is-illusory&#34; class=&#34;level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Personal Property Is Illusory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the pony farm, when you get right down to it, the notion of owning things, or more nebulously, &lt;em&gt;places&lt;/em&gt;, hardly seems like it should be a given. In fact, the only really solid reason that the things I consider to be “mine” continue to be so is because of the threat of violence by either myself or (more likely, let’s face it) the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems like a more fundamental state of affairs, admittedly. I have a somewhat naïve notion that even non-human animals defend their property rights to some extent, viz. a hunting animal defending its fresh kill against a scavenger. But the extent to which humans have taken property rights seems a lot more extreme. Humans &lt;em&gt;hoard&lt;/em&gt;, sometimes wildly excessively (I’m thinking here of billionaires, not people whose houses are full of junk), in a way that seems plainly influenced by capitalism. Be it a competitive impulse, spurred on by that illusory notion of “success,” or a fear of finding oneself &lt;em&gt;without necessary things&lt;/em&gt; and the valuable labor required to obtain them, the human acquisitive impulse doesn’t seem like a super healthy one. But what does a society look like when you don’t take personal property as a given? Obviously I’m not the first person to ask this. It’s just been on my mind a little more this year as I’ve been questioning things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;whats-my-motivation&#34; class=&#34;level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s My Motivation?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;
David Hume
&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisitive impulse I mentioned in the last paragraph seems to be driven by two main emotions: &lt;em&gt;shame&lt;/em&gt; (of being compared to one’s peers and found inferior) and &lt;em&gt;fear&lt;/em&gt; (of losing everything and being unable to live). Maybe that’s not accurate, but bear with me. The point is that people engage in unhealthy behavior all the time. Sometimes it’s long-term unhealthy, because we don’t have a great grasp of long term consequences (helloooo, global warming). But sometimes we do things that feel shitty immediately or &lt;em&gt;even as we’re doing them&lt;/em&gt; and don’t really know why. &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; do such things all the time, for sure. And I often don’t know why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My question is: &lt;em&gt;why the fuck not?&lt;/em&gt; Why isn’t the very basic skill of being able to assess your own motivations for your own actions (and thereby determine whether those motivations are healthy ones) a fundamental thing that’s taught in every school? As I mentioned much earlier in this post, I want to start therapy in 2019, and I hope to get better at this skill there. But why aren’t we taught the value of it, and some ways to do it, earlier? Per the David Hume quote above, why is our schooling all reason and no passions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, I think I know at least a couple reasons why. If I may be slightly glib, they are: patriarchy, which overvalues the “male-associated” virtue of reason and devalues the “female” realm of feelings and emotions; and capitalism, which assigns literal value to those areas commensurate with patriarchy’s priorities. This feeds into part of what people who talk about “toxic masculinity” are talking about, I’m pretty sure: the inability or refusal to acknowledge the emotional motivations for one’s actions (and, by extension, the legitimacy of other people’s feelings) because of our society-wide stigmatization of emotion leads to doing harmful things you insist are based on pure reason but are actually driven by emotions that you’re not even aware of. I know about this because it took me until about the age of 30 to start recovering from it. (See &lt;em&gt;Therapy&lt;/em&gt;, above.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;anyway-thats-it&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anyway That’s It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t feel like trying to wrap this up in an elegant way. Here’s to 2019 not being a total shitshow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

            <id>http://ian.mccowan.space/2018/08/19/Spacemacs_To_Doom/</id>
            <updated>2018-08-19T05:20:00Z</updated>
            
            <summary type="html">I’ve been trying out &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs&#34;&gt;Doom Emacs&lt;/a&gt; recently, because I guess I can’t go more than like 2 years without wanting to throw my current text editing situation out the window and replace it with a new one.</summary>
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been trying out &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs&#34;&gt;Doom Emacs&lt;/a&gt; recently, because I guess I can’t go more than like 2 years without wanting to throw my current text editing situation out the window and replace it with a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That current text editing situation is &lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/2015/04/07/Spacemacs/index.html&#34;&gt;Spacemacs&lt;/a&gt;. It’s starting to feel kind of clunky, with too many moving parts to configure straightforwardly, slow to start up and slow to receive updates. Aside from those complaints, though, it’s honestly still pretty great: it’s Emacs so it has support for everything under the sun, the “configuration layer” system is actually a very nice way to organize functionality, and the “multi-tiered leader” keybinding paradigm is the best of any editor I’ve ever used, so much so that I’m not sure I could switch to another one at this point. That rather limits my options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doom is an Emacs configuration framework that, in the words of its creator,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;strives to be fast, fabulous and hacker friendly. It is tailored for neckbeards with blue belts or better in command-line-fu, Elisp and git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;marginnote&#34;&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/assets/images/posts/Spacemacs_To_Doom_Migration/cacochan.png&#34; rel=&#34;bytebox&#34;&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;Cute drawing of a Doom cacodemon saying &#39;Yay evil!&#39;&#34; src=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/assets/images/posts/Spacemacs_To_Doom_Migration/cacochan.png&#34; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; Plus there’s this guy! Aww! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I… guess I’m those things? I guess using this would be a good way to find out? I don’t know, “fast” just sounds really good right now. Anyway here’s a summary of what I found out in trying to switch from Spacemacs to Doom, in case someone finds it useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;should-i-bother&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Should I bother?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, some subjective impressions from easing into Doom over a period of one or two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does generally feel faster. Definitely much quicker to start up, though I think a lot of my long startup time with Spacemacs was loading my workspace with a lot of open Ruby buffers. On the other hand, loading a bunch of buffers shouldn’t take as long as it did (we’re talking a minute or more), and…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If something goes wrong in Spacemacs, it can be very hard to figure out why. There are a lot of moving parts all interacting with each other. Doom feels more manageable, but this may just be because I haven’t been using it long enough to accrete a lot of possibly hacky changes of my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spacemacs looked pretty nice, for Emacs, but Doom does (subjectively) look even better. I haven’t felt the need to mess with the aesthetics as much, which is good because that was a source of considerable frustration with Spacemacs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spacemacs is definitely more “batteries included” than Doom, and a more comprehensively customized Emacs experience. The bindings are tweaked to be more “Vim-esque” in basically every mode Spacemacs provides through its clever “evilification” process, and language layers tend to have more functionality out of the box (e.g. auto-closing tags in Web mode). Still, there haven’t been too many things I find myself really missing in Doom, though I should say I’ve been mostly working with Ruby on Rails in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doom’s developer is very accessible via a &lt;a href=&#34;https://discord.gg/bcZ6P3y&#34;&gt;Discord chat&lt;/a&gt;. Spacemacs’s isn’t so much — it’s kind of been a victim of its own success in that way — but it has a bigger community. On the other hand, I’ve found Doom’s source a little easier to inspect to figure things out for myself. Ultimately, the amount of support available for each is a wash: I’ve felt the need to ask for help less with Doom, but there also seem to be fewer places to get it if I need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;how-do-i-set-it-up&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do I set it up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doom is in a bit of a state of flux right now, so I’m going to try to make these instructions future-proof: Go to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs&#34;&gt;Doom github&lt;/a&gt; and follow the instructions in the README. If they work, great! If they don’t, it might be because the &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch is broken. Try switching to &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; (using your &lt;em&gt;blue belt in Git&lt;/em&gt;) and follow the instructions in &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; README. If that doesn’t work either, I guess someone probably opened an issue about it? Find that. It’s the work of one person so if you have a weird setup and it breaks and you don’t want to figure out why, Doom might just not be for you. It definitely wasn’t the first time I tried it, so I don’t mean that as a dig or anything! There will just be a certain amount of figuring things out yourself that will come with the territory, and switching might not really be worth that friction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;where-do-i-put-my-shit&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where do I put my shit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you know as “layers” in Spacemacs are, more or less, called “modules” in Doom. You’re going to be creating a private &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/wiki/Modules&#34;&gt;module&lt;/a&gt;. It will be located at either &lt;code&gt;~/.doom.d&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;config/doom&lt;/code&gt; if you’re doing the whole &lt;a href=&#34;https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html&#34;&gt;XDG base directory&lt;/a&gt; thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike in Spacemacs where a private layer is just the “recommended” way of storing your configuration (you could, in many cases, have it all in your &lt;code&gt;.spacemacs&lt;/code&gt; if you wanted), in Doom your configuration directory just &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a private module. It has the following parts, each of which corresponds roughly to something you know and love from Spacemacs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;init.el&lt;/code&gt; - Every module has one, but for our basic purposes the one in your private module will be equivalent to the &lt;code&gt;setq dotspacemacs-configuration-layers&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;.spacemacs&lt;/code&gt;. Basically it’s one call to the &lt;code&gt;doom!&lt;/code&gt; macro to declare the features that you want to use. I guess you can put other very early configuration in there but I haven’t yet seen a reason to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;packages.el&lt;/code&gt; - You might &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; this is like a Spacemacs layer’s &lt;code&gt;packages.el&lt;/code&gt;, but no! It is a simple declarative list of packages using the &lt;code&gt;package!&lt;/code&gt; macro that does little but add packages to be installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;config.el&lt;/code&gt; - A combination of &lt;code&gt;user-config&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;.spacemacs&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;config.el&lt;/code&gt; in your private layer, and &lt;code&gt;packages.el&lt;/code&gt; in your private layer. I think. That’s a lot for one file but you can have other files starting with a &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and load them manually, like &lt;code&gt;(load +more)&lt;/code&gt; to load &lt;code&gt;+more.el&lt;/code&gt;. Presumably this is to break up all the configuration that would otherwise be unceremoniously dumped in &lt;code&gt;config.el&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;autoload.el&lt;/code&gt; - Equivalent to &lt;code&gt;funcs.el&lt;/code&gt; in your private layer. Or you can have an &lt;code&gt;autoload&lt;/code&gt; directory and put multiple files’ worth of functions in it, just named whatever you want I guess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;keybindings&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keybindings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The keybindings in Doom are both like and unlike those in Spacemacs. They have the same multi-level branching key sequence thing going on, and a lot of the top-level “categorizing” bindings are the same: &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; for windows, &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; for buffers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately (for you and me as Spacemacs refugees) the bindings are also &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; different enough to trip you up. &lt;code&gt;SPC b [&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SPC b ]&lt;/code&gt; go to the previous or next buffer instead of &lt;code&gt;SPC b p&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SPC b n&lt;/code&gt;. You open Magit’s status with &lt;code&gt;SPC g g&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;SPC g s&lt;/code&gt;. Perhaps worst of all, “save what I’m working on now” is a &lt;em&gt;buffer&lt;/em&gt; command under &lt;code&gt;SPC b s&lt;/code&gt; instead of a &lt;em&gt;file&lt;/em&gt; command at &lt;code&gt;SPC f s&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately you’re probably acquainted with both Vim &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Emacs so remapping keys is second nature to you. The Doom way to do it is to use the &lt;code&gt;map!&lt;/code&gt; macro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, &lt;code&gt;map!&lt;/code&gt; isn’t terribly well documented in Doom’s actual documentation, but it is in the code, so search for &lt;code&gt;defmacro map!&lt;/code&gt; in the repo and read the comment. For supplementary material, refer to my example auxiliary config file, in which I’m depositing all my bindings transferred over from Spacemacs so all that muscle memory doesn’t go to waste. Feel free to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/valrus/doom-private-module/blob/master/%2Bspacemacs-bindings.el&#34;&gt;copy it for yourself&lt;/a&gt;, and if you do, don’t forget to &lt;code&gt;load&lt;/code&gt; it from your &lt;code&gt;config.el&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;adding-packages&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adding packages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doom comes with a pretty good swath of functionality built in, but since you’re a Spacemacs user you’ll probably find some things you miss before too long. Here’s the basics of how you add a package to Doom, with &lt;code&gt;linum-relative&lt;/code&gt; as an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type=&#34;1&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;(package! linum-relative)&lt;/code&gt; to your &lt;code&gt;packages.el&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a &lt;code&gt;def-package!&lt;/code&gt; call to your &lt;code&gt;config.el&lt;/code&gt;. This one turns on relative line numbers in all buffers and makes sure they use the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/news/NEWS.26.1&#34;&gt;native line numbers&lt;/a&gt; in Emacs 26:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(def-package! linum-relative
  :config

&lt;li&gt;Restart Emacs, or run the &lt;code&gt;doom/reload&lt;/code&gt; command with &lt;code&gt;SPC :&lt;/code&gt;. (Or use the key sequence &lt;code&gt;SPC h R&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a Spacemacs user and thinking about trying Doom, I hope this helps you! Here are a couple other blog posts that could be helpful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aria Edmonds’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@aria_39488/getting-started-with-doom-emacs-a-great-transition-from-vim-to-emacs-9bab8e0d8458&#34;&gt;Getting started with Doom Emacs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Justin DeMaris’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/urbint-engineering/emacs-doom-for-newbies-1f8038604e3b&#34;&gt;Emacs Doom for Newbies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, please feel free to check out my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/valrus/doom-private-module&#34;&gt;personal Doom config&lt;/a&gt; if you want a starting point. And here are some others that might provide inspiration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs-private&#34;&gt;the Doom developer’s&lt;/a&gt;, assuredly a better canonical example than mine of How To Do Things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Emiller88/doom-emacs-private&#34;&gt;Emiller88’s&lt;/a&gt;, a fairly simple example of a “literate” config which looks lovely in GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/fuxialexander/doom-emacs-private-xfu&#34;&gt;fuxialexander’s&lt;/a&gt;, a more complex config with lots of customization and added features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ar1a/dotfiles/tree/master/emacs/.doom.d&#34;&gt;ar1a’s&lt;/a&gt;, as seen in her nice blog post linked above&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Dooming!&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Someone in &lt;a href=&#34;https://fediverse.party/&#34;&gt;the Fediverse&lt;/a&gt; tooted&lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;The Fediverse is, loosely speaking, a constellation of open source social media replacements, of which &lt;a href=&#34;https://joinmastodon.org/&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, on which &lt;a href=&#34;https://icosahedron.website/@valrus&#34;&gt;I have an account&lt;/a&gt;, is one. Yes, the analogue of “tweeting” is called “tooting” there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a probability problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A, B and C toot the truth with a probability of 1/3 and lie with a probability of 2/3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A makes a toot and B toots an observation on whether or not A was tooting the truth or not. C toots that B confirmed A was truthful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the actual probability that A’s toot was truthful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re into solving this kind of problem, please stop reading this post and work it out for yourself now. Subsequent paragraphs will discuss the solution in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;the-obvious-answer&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Obvious Answer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first guess, and the obvious “this is a trick question” answer, was ⅓, on the assumption that the only relevant information is in the first sentence. But I second guessed myself, because the question seemed naggingly similar to the infamous &lt;a href=&#34;http://marilynvossavant.com/game-show-problem/&#34;&gt;Monty Hall problem&lt;/a&gt;, where the “obvious” answer is also wrong, and quite counterintuitively so to most people including myself. I worked out the problem in a different way, and got a different answer. But the poster of the original toot asserted that the correct answer is ⅓: the information about B and C is all irrelevant, and the answer is given to you in the first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, that feeling of similarity to the Monty Hall problem bothered me, and though my probability class is pretty far behind me now, I did dimly recall learning about something called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference&#34;&gt;Bayesian inference&lt;/a&gt;, which basically lets you update the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, “A told the truth”) as you get more information with the use of a pretty simple equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;bayesd-and-confused&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bayes’d and Confused&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem&#34;&gt;Bayes’s Theorem&lt;/a&gt; isn’t generally stated this way, but I like the following statement of it: think of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; as the event whose probability we’re trying to determine and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(E\)&lt;/span&gt; as the event that we consider to be evidence for (or against) it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[ P(X|E) = {P(E|X) \over P(E)} \cdot P(X) \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(P(X|E)\)&lt;/span&gt; is the probability that &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; occurred given that we’ve observed &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(E\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(P(X)\)&lt;/span&gt; is the probability of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(P(X)\)&lt;/span&gt; happening in absence of any other information, this formulation is nice because you can think of that factor &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(P(E|X) / P(E)\)&lt;/span&gt; as the effect that our observing &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(E\)&lt;/span&gt; has on the likelihood that &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does that factor mean, though? First off, it’s not a probability. If &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; makes &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(E\)&lt;/span&gt; more likely, the numerator will be larger than the demoninator, so it won’t be less than 1 like a good probability should. But that framing also lets us think of it as a regular old ratio: since the numerator is “&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(E\)&lt;/span&gt; given &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt;” and the demoninator is “&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(E\)&lt;/span&gt; alone,” the ratio is basically “how much more likely does &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; make &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(E\)&lt;/span&gt;?” So the full theorem, using this formulation, can be stated as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conditional probability of some event &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt;, given some evidence &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(E\)&lt;/span&gt;, is equal to the unconditional probability of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; times the effect of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; on the probability of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(E\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(E\)&lt;/span&gt; has &lt;em&gt;already occurred&lt;/em&gt;, if we know that &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt;’s occurring would have made it more likely, then we have more reason to believe &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; itself happened than in the absence of any information about &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(E\)&lt;/span&gt; (and vice versa). That’s the intuition that Bayes’s theorem makes precise; regardless of whether the intuition is intuitive to you, the theorem is true, and I’m going to move on to applying it to the Toot Enigma and determining whether the answer actually is ⅓.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;the-toot-enigma&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Toot Enigma&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, so first off: there is, I &lt;em&gt;suppose&lt;/em&gt;, a case to be made that by saying “actual probability,” the original tooter specifically meant “probability in the absense of any additional evidence,” in which case all the Bayes stuff is irrelevant and the answer is straightforwardly, indeed &lt;em&gt;tautologically&lt;/em&gt; ⅓. But I think that interpretation of the problem is not only contrary to how probability problems are usually understood (if you’re trying to determine how likely something is, wouldn’t you &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; want to take into account all relevant evidence?), but also &lt;em&gt;painfully boring&lt;/em&gt;. So, Bayes to the rescue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; is the event whose probability we’re trying to determine: “A told the truth.” &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(E\)&lt;/span&gt; is the available evidence: “C said B confirmed A told the truth.” Since we’re told that &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(E\)&lt;/span&gt; has occurred, we’re interested in finding &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(P(X|E)\)&lt;/span&gt;. We’re also given that &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(P(X) = 1/3\)&lt;/span&gt;. So to finish the calculation, we need &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(P(E)\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(P(E|X)\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a truth table for this, to take into account the eight (&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(2^3\)&lt;/span&gt;) different combinations of truth or falsehood on the part of A, B and C. For each of these, “T” means “told the truth” and “F” means “lied.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style=&#34;width:47%;&#34;&gt;

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;F&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;F&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;T&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;A lies. B lies that A told the truth. C says B confirmed A.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;F&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;F&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;F&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;A lies. B lies that A told the truth. C lies that B didn’t confirm A.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First let’s find &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(P(E)\)&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(E\)&lt;/span&gt; is any case where C says B confirmed A: 1, 4, 6 and 7. The probabilities of those cases are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1: &lt;code&gt;TTT&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\((1/3)^3 = 1/27\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4: &lt;code&gt;TFF&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\((1/3)(2/3)^2 = 4/27\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6: &lt;code&gt;FTF&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\((2/3)(1/3)(2/3) = 4/27\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7: &lt;code&gt;FFT&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\((2/3)^2(1/3) = 4/27\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with a sum of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(13/27\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(P(E|X)\)&lt;/span&gt;: the conditional probability that C says B confirmed A, given that A told the truth. This is easiest to calculate as &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(P(E \cap X) / P(X)\)&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(P(E \cap X)\)&lt;/span&gt;, the probability that A tells the truth &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; C says B confirms A, is just the subset of the cases of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(P(E)\)&lt;/span&gt; where A also told the truth: 1 and 4. Those have a combined probability of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(5/27\)&lt;/span&gt;. Finally, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(P(X) = 1/3\)&lt;/span&gt;. So, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(P(E|X) = P(E \cap X) / P(X) = (5/27) / (1/3) = 5/9\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting this all together in Bayes’s theorem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[P(X|E) = {P(E|X) \over P(E)} \cdot P(X) = { { 5 \over 9} \over {13 \over 27} } \cdot {1 \over 3 } = {5 \over 9} \cdot {27 \over 13} \cdot {1 \over 3} = { 5 \over 13 }\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a bit more than ⅓: the additional information about B and C actually did give us a little more confidence that A told the truth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;conclusion&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probability is complicated and counterintuitive. Never trust your intuition unless you’ve got a theorem backing it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;epilogue-a-simpler-solution&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Epilogue: A Simpler Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were looking for &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(P(X|E)\)&lt;/span&gt;. That doesn’t actually require a detour through Bayes’s theorem: we could have just used the definition of conditional probability, combined with the truth table above. &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(P(X \cap E)\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(P(E \cap X)\)&lt;/span&gt; are the same, so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[P(X|E) = {P(X \cap E) \over P(E)} = { {5 \over 27 } \over {13 \over 27} } = {5 \over 13}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I just thought this post was more fun with a detour through Bayes’s theorem, which is quite possibly the most important theorem in probability theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ask.metafilter.com/321013/Help-me-figure-out-whats-up-with-this-probability-question&#34;&gt;Ask MetaFilter&lt;/a&gt; for backing me up when I was doubting myself on this one. The discussion there is worth reading, especially &lt;a href=&#34;https://ask.metafilter.com/321013/Help-me-figure-out-whats-up-with-this-probability-question#4629395&#34;&gt;this comment&lt;/a&gt; for a concise justification of why we need to take the information about B and C into account.)&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My employer &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bonanza.com/jobs&#34;&gt;Bonanza&lt;/a&gt; has an interesting employee benefit called “Freedom February,” where during that month every employee gets a week’s worth of free days off and some cash to offset the cost of using those days to take a tropical vacation should they desire to do so. Generally, several months in advance, employees decide on a few specific destinations and those who want to travel with their co-workers choose one from among them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a generally travel- and planning-averse person, I opted for the easiest destination, and then watched helplessly as it hemorrhaged people until there were too few to make it worth the while of anyone still nominally on board to plan. That scheme having fallen through, I resolved to use February to do some #adulting and take care of some imposing tasks that I otherwise foresaw myself putting off as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of these was doing my taxes, probably earlier in the year than any time in the last decade. It was boring and this post will not mention it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second was getting a vasectomy, which I had “wanted” to do ever since I found out it was a thing but been putting off pretty casually for probably about ten years and then more aggressively for another five once I got to a place in my life where it actually seemed like a viable option. Those last five years started when I got a mandatory pre-procedure consultation and then balked (and balked, and balked) purely because of the small-scale practical considerations.&lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;As opposed to uncertainty or doubt, which I never experienced in those fifteen years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First among these considerations, from one perspective, was the doctor at that consultation telling me I wouldn’t be able to bike after the procedure for &lt;em&gt;two to three weeks!&lt;/em&gt; Cycling is my primary way of getting around, and this seemed like just an insurmountably style-cramping restriction on my mobility: a big enough disruption to my normal life routine to require significant planning around it. But during Freedom February, pretty much everyone who didn’t zip off to a tropical paradise at least works from home for most or all of the month. So my excuse of having my commute borked was irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that excuse gone, though, I saw the looming procedure from a new perspective: one from which the previously insurmountable obstacle of negotiating transportation seemed utterly trivial next to the real and imminent prospect of having a complete stranger (1) focus their attention intensely on my scrotum for a half hour and also (2) cut it and certain of its contents with a knife. I have only recently become even mildly comfortable being seen naked, even in contexts like locker rooms where it’s 100% standard, so even the first part was going to take some getting used to, to say nothing of the second. But I knew if I gave myself &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much time to get used to it, I would never get it done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that my ambivalence and anxiety about all this is not uncommon. Insofar as I have a purpose in writing this, it is to reassure any other bashful and anxiety-prone male-bodied people who are considering getting a vasectomy that while their anxiety about it isn’t &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; misplaced, it’s probably not as bad as they imagine or fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to go to Planned Parenthood to have the procedure done, because I believe they do important work and I wanted any money that I (or my insurance) had to pay to go to them. Having done so, I recommend them wholeheartedly. Based on my experience, the whole process goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;the-consultation&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The consultation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either because it had been years since my last consultation about it, or because that consultation wasn’t with Planned Parenthood, I had to have another one. The consultation is sort of like easy mode for the actual procedure. There will be some rather frank discussion of your genitals and what will be happening to them: somewhat like a more intimate version of the reproduction part of your high school health class. If you are a prude like me it will be somewhat uncomfortable, but you’re not in high school anymore, &lt;em&gt;thank God&lt;/em&gt;, and everyone will actually be a grown-up, which is good because they will also need to look at your penis. This will probably be near the end of the consultation and I guess it is to make sure there’s nothing going on down there that would complicate the procedure? I don’t know. Possibly due to my own mild neuroses, my theory is they’re making sure that you’re mentally prepared to drop trou when a doctor tells you to, because otherwise you’re probably gonna have some difficulty when the time for the actual vasectomy rolls around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, if you finish the consultation and haven’t changed your mind, I recommend you schedule the procedure before you leave. This will keep you from putting it off for another several years and thus requiring &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; consultation later, ultimately reducing the number of strangers who have to look at your penis by one. These are the kind of optimizations that I, as a now-seasoned vasectomy expert&lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-2&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-2&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-men-in-us-dont-get-vasectomies&#34;&gt;Per 2015 statistics&lt;/a&gt;, I am in approximately the top 10% of “married or in-union” American men in for number of vasectomies achieved, which makes me an expert by any reasonable definition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, can help you achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;pre-procedure-preparation&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pre-Procedure Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interval between your consultation and when you scheduled the actual vasectomy, you will definitely not think or feel any anxiety about it, so I’ll proceed directly to the day of the main event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will have to arrange some transportation. If you currently have a partner and they’re available and on board with your decision, look: I’m not the boss of them or you, but I think it would be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; reasonable for them to be your chauffeur for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the consultation, you will have been told to shower. They might also have asked you to shave your scrotum. My above claim to be an expert does not apply here, but I can tell you that if you use a double-edge (or “safety”) razor on your face, you’re in for an interesting experience.&lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-3&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-3&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;If you normally use a straight razor, you’re probably in for an even more interesting one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Just remember: unless you do something absolutely catastrophic, any cuts you inflict on yourself will probably be shallower than the one you signed up for later today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;the-procedure&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The procedure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the procedure starts, someone will talk you through the process. It will be more or less a rehash of what you were told in the consultation, I guess &lt;em&gt;in case you forgot&lt;/em&gt; in the intervening time that you’re about to get your scrotum straight up cut open or that (equally importantly, in my opinion!) it will be anesthetized for the duration. At Planned Parenthood, they also offered me Xanax to help manage my anxiety. I was on the fence but ultimately accepted, partly because I had to admit I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; pretty anxious but also to see if I would find out what Chance the Rapper was on about in &lt;em&gt;Acid Rap&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: I did not find out what Chance the Rapper was on about in &lt;em&gt;Acid Rap&lt;/em&gt;. In fact the Xanax did not feel like it had much of an effect on my mental state at all. But considering how anxious I was about the procedure, the fact that I felt ❝pretty normal❞&lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-4&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-4&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;I’m trying to spread the convention of using these big quotes as dramatically overemphasized finger-flexion air quotes. Unfortunately they’re font-dependent and not as distinctive in this font as I’d prefer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; during it probably means that actually, the drugs did what they were supposed to. (My dosage was also a lot lower than Chance’s, no doubt.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider things to have really gotten started when I was given a heating pad and told to strip from the waist down. The heating pad was to wrap around my pertinent areas: I was told it would make things easier for the doctor if they were warm — the rest of the office was rather cold — this seemed intuitively reasonable, though I didn’t care to think too hard about it. But making things easier for the doctor did seem like an extraordinarily good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I’d made myself ❝comfortable,❞ the doctor came in. I guess we exchanged some pleasantries or something. He probably reiterated the process again to some extent. To be honest, mostly what I remember is the, like, &lt;em&gt;scrotum bib&lt;/em&gt; that he put on me: basically one of those scratchy blue protective sheets like doctors and dentists use to prevent your various effluvia from getting on things, with a conveniently-sized hole in it. I remember involuntarily thinking about that stupid damn &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thelonelyisland.com/videos/dick-in-a-box/&#34;&gt;Dick in a Box&lt;/a&gt; SNL short and experiencing a complicated tangle of emotions at having it thus forcibly invoked and recontextualized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, let’s talk about that air-quotes ❝pretty normal❞ a few paragraphs up. You might think that what I mean by that is “pretty normal, &lt;em&gt;considering&lt;/em&gt;” or “pretty normal, &lt;em&gt;aside from&lt;/em&gt;” and while there were admittedly a few interjections from the doctor that would be &lt;em&gt;unexpected&lt;/em&gt; in a typical polite conversation&lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-5&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-5&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;The most notable and unlikely of these being a bright and chipper “Wanna see your vas?” While I understood the impulse — this is, after all, a once in a lifetime opportunity, one fervently hopes — my baseline level of adventurousness had been exhausted when I accepted the Xanax.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, overall we mostly small talked about our hobbies and things. In fact I was probably at least as comfortable as I usually am when I’m cornered into directionless small talk in any other setting. At the time this seemed completely unremarkable. In retrospect it seems like extremely strong evidence that the Xanax worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will, perhaps, be curious about the pain level. I haven’t mentioned it yet because it was almost too mild to bear mentioning, but since it was a significant source of my own anxiety I’ll expand on that a little. I can’t speak to anyone else’s experience, but on at least one occasion the doctor said something like “You’ll feel a little pinch in 3… 2… 1…” and at the end of the countdown I felt &lt;em&gt;nothing whatsoever&lt;/em&gt;. On other occasions I did feel some pain, sometimes without any warning, but not once was it worse than if I’d cut myself while shaving. Overall: extremely strong evidence that the local anesthetic &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;recovery&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recovery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d love to be able to tell you that when the anesthetic wore off it hurt like hell, and that I gritted my teeth and toughed it out, &lt;em&gt;like a Man.&lt;/em&gt; In fact: no. And not “no, I failed to tough it out,” but “no, the pain was almost negligible.” When the anesthetic wore off I was, like, a little sore. I popped a couple acetaminophen the first night afterwards, and didn’t even feel the need to bother after that. Getting kicked in the balls in Tae Kwon Do, as a child, was worse. My partner probably suffers worse and longer-lasting pain &lt;em&gt;every month&lt;/em&gt; from cramps. In fact, By quantifying my pain levels using an adapted version of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmidt_sting_pain_index&#34;&gt;Schmidt sting pain index&lt;/a&gt; — they topped out at about a 1.2 — and comparing pain sources using some basic integral calculus, I proved that the most &lt;em&gt;cumulative&lt;/em&gt; pain I experienced as a result of my vasectomy was collateral damage to adjacent areas when the my hair started growing back and got to that point where it was all spiky. (It’s now been about three weeks and it’s actually still at that point, though it’s finally tapering off.) That couple weeks’ worth of minor, intermittent discomfort adds up to more pain than I experienced during the actual vasectomy and subsequent recovery period.&lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-6&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-6&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;I did not actually do any of the math stuff. Nevertheless I stand by my conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;in-summary&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have been thinking about getting a vasectomy but anxiety about awkwardness or pain has kept you from following through, I’m here to tell you it’s probably not nearly as bad as you imagine. And it’s the responsible thing to do if you don’t want kids, far easier than the equivalent procedure for your potentially childbearing partner and more reliable than lots of other kinds of birth control. Finally, if my experience is any indication, it may even make you more comfortable discussing and taking control of your sexual health, which I think is an important thing to be able to do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, in a couple months I’m going to have to rub one out into a jar, bring it across town, and &lt;em&gt;hand it to another human&lt;/em&gt; so they can check and make sure the vasectomy worked. While my experience with the vasectomy has given me the utmost confidence that the professionalism of the Planned Parenthood staff will make this minimally awkward, please do not expect a detailed follow-up blog post about that experience. Thanks for reading???&lt;/p&gt;

            <updated>2017-12-08T05:20:00Z</updated>

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve written, recorded and released into the wild about a dozen completely original songs, but I still don’t really have a process for writing them, or at least not a conscious one. This post is an attempt to figure out what works for me and what doesn’t. I’m not, by basically any conventional measure, a “successful” songwriter, nor do I pretend it’s anything other than a part time hobby for me. So don’t construe this as advice or think I imagine myself to be a model for other songwriters to emulate. I’m just thinking through what, if any, process I personally have, to try to have a little more control over it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of half-formed lyrics sitting around in notebooks and a lot of snippets of music sitting around on my hard drive, or, more rarely, on sheet music. Some of these I like well enough, but very few of them ever end up becoming songs I like enough to finish, much less release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the spectrum, I’ve had a few song ideas just come to me—this is a total cop-out phrase, but bear with me—and then sort of unfold into entire songs very quickly and easily. A couple notable recent examples of this: “&lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/studio?song=Where%20No%20One%20Has%20Gone%20Before&#34;&gt;Where No One Has Gone Before&lt;/a&gt;,” whose intro verse melody sprang up more or less fully formed during a long bike ride&lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;I distinctly remember stopping at a park to record the melody into my phone. I’m self-conscious about recording in the best of conditions; doing so in public means I had what seemed like a guaranteed Eventual Actual Song. And I did!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and “&lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/studio?song=The%20Ice%20World&#34;&gt;The Ice World&lt;/a&gt;,” where the first verse’s lyric just fell out of my emotional state at the time with melody attached. In both of these cases the rest of the lyric followed fairly quickly, and in a way that felt inevitable or at least very natural. Any other melodies in the song were pretty straightforward to derive from that first flash of inspiration as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Inspiration” is, of course, the biggest cop-out word of them all. What the hell is “inspiration?” It seems un-analyzable: we imagine it as a bolt of lightning, powerful, random, impossible to command. I’m not going to try to lasso that lightning here, at least not yet. But some flashes of inspiration lead me to fully fleshed out songs, and others sputter out. What’s the difference?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lyrical seeds that grow most easily into entire songs tend to combine an emotion or feeling with a metaphor or analogy robust enough to create a sort of feedback loop: the metaphor describes how I feel somehow, and other associated thoughts and emotions reinforce that metaphor by leading to a new perspective on it or introducing a second one that I can tie in. Then the additional detail or clarity on the metaphorical side leads to a deeper or more nuanced understanding of my real-life emotional state, and so on… and before long I’ve got a whole lyric written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s kind of the large-scale conceptual framework that seems to be reliably fruitful for me. Harder to pin down is what makes an initial seed hooky enough to warrant expanding it into a whole song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reliable technique I’ve discovered for evaluating “hookiness” is to refrain from recording or writing down a melody until I’ve figured out how to expand on it. If I forget it before then, it wasn’t a good enough hook. This is risky, but at the same time it seems to work well. I’m not necessarily trying to write earworms, but “enough to stick for a few days” seems like a good lower bound on catchiness. It also leaves the melody a little space to lead to another section of the song, before I pin it down and trap it under a chord progression. That tends to constrain the directions I can take it, which is essential after a certain point but not something I want to do prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding fragments into actual songs needs to feel fairly intuitive to me. I don’t like to feel like I’m fighting with my songs, and it always seems like the results get worse the more I have to do so. If I have a verse and a chorus and can’t figure out how to tie the two together, it’s often a sign that the weaker&lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-2&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-2&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;How do I determine what’s “weaker?” I kind of just have to trust my own judgment from being a music fan for about 20 years. Some red flags: lyrics that are too vague or use too many words to say too little, or that are metrically awkward; melodies that feel clichéd or obvious; too-contrived or (sometimes) too-basic chord progressions; things I don’t enjoy listening to myself; things I dread having to record in such a way that they sound good.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; one needs to go or be radically re-written so it fits better. Having a strong overarching concept helps here, as does having some kind of rhythmic or harmonic framework. Any of those things help constrain where I can go from what I have, which is desirable after I have enough seed material to sustain a whole song. At that point, anything that enables me to throw out bad options more easily makes the whole process less of a struggle. Though I don’t have much technical proficiency in any instrument, which immediately limits my options to “things I can actually play,” modern DAWs still provide a glut of sonic options that need to be pared back to avoid analysis paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;

            <id>http://ian.mccowan.space/2017/10/23/Wheel_Turn_2/</id>
            <updated>2017-10-23T05:20:00Z</updated>
            
            
            <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get stomped like a snake&lt;br /&gt;
Lie down in the dirt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have, mercifully, been doored only once in the approximately twelve years I’ve been cycling as my primary mode of transportation. If you are unaware, being “doored,” as a cyclist, means having a car door opened directly into your path of travel too suddenly to avoid it. I don’t know if all doorings are the same, but mine was a startling and wholly disorienting experience. I was cycling merrily along at probably somewhere between twelve and fifteen miles per hour, and then, before my brain even had a chance to process what had happened, I was horizontal in the middle of the street. I was lucky, in that I suffered no serious injuries from being knocked over, and luckier still, in that there was not a car just behind me to run me over and kill me instantly. But it only takes one dooring to make you aware of that possibility every time you ride down a bike lane idiotically placed immediately to the left of a stream of parked cars, any of which could at any time be populated by a person about to emerge and commit involuntary manslaughter in so doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cling to my convictions even when I get hurt&lt;br /&gt;
Be an upstanding, well-loved man about town&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still use bike lanes, even ones that run alongside parked cars, despite the risk of being doored. I still operate under the regrettable delusion that I can be “one of the good ones” who doesn’t inconvenience drivers by riding to the left of the bike lane, taking up the “car” lane and preventing them from driving at their customary five miles over the speed limit. See, drivers? Bikes and cars can co-exist just fine, and I don’t have to be in your way! I don’t run stop signs, nor red lights, even though it would often afford me the opportunity to ride a few blocks without being in anyone’s way! I’m a responsible, law-abiding cyclist! Please don’t hurt me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I tried the losing side&lt;br /&gt;
I don’t want to die in here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve been getting the Mountain Goats’ song “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKVY5_FB2i0&#34;&gt;Heel Turn 2&lt;/a&gt;,” from their 2015 album &lt;em&gt;Beat the Champ&lt;/em&gt;, stuck in my head a lot while cycling. It’s a catchy song, of course, but I listen to a lot of those. For some reason, riding my bike in traffic seems to put me in the mood to ponder whether being one of the good ones is worth occasionally feeling like my life could be drastically changed or possibly ended in an instant by someone who failed to notice me, because I was being too polite, because I was trying not to inconvenience anyone. To “turn heel,” in professional wrestling, means basically to turn from a good guy to a bad guy. The protagonist in “Heel Turn 2” isn’t turning heel because they think it’d be fun. They’re doing it because they think it offers them a better shot at survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You found my breaking point, congratulations&lt;br /&gt;
Spent too much of my life now trying to play fair&lt;br /&gt;
Throw my better self overboard, shoot at him when he comes up for air&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would I feel safer, I wonder, if I tossed aside my compulsion to unobtrusiveness and did all the things that ensure that drivers notice you, sometimes at the cost of pissing them off? &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.seattlebikeblog.com/2017/10/13/what-can-we-learn-from-this-scary-close-call-video&#34;&gt;In some memorable cases&lt;/a&gt;, the answer seems to be a clear and terrifying no. But what if the cyclist had stayed courteously to the right, in the bike lane, and—as can happen at virtually any time, with little or no warning—been doored, and knocked directly into the path of that truck? How many instances of cars cutting me off to turn right across the bike lane in front of me could I avoid by just claiming the “car” lane, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dol.wa.gov/business/drivertraining/docs/bicycletestanswers.pdf&#34;&gt;as is permitted by law&lt;/a&gt; in Washington and many other states, and denying them the ability to do so? How many cars could I prevent from passing me dangerously closely if I rode in the middle of the lane rather than courteously hugging the curb to allow them to pass? Is it worth it to be an impediment, but one who is &lt;em&gt;sure to be noticed&lt;/em&gt;, if occasionally I incur the wrath of someone who thinks I’m out of my place and decides to try to scare me back into it? Would I rather risk injury by neglect, or by malevolence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let all the trash rain down from way up in the rafters&lt;br /&gt;
I’m walking out of here in one piece&lt;br /&gt;
Don’t care what comes after&lt;br /&gt;
Drive the wedge, torch the bridge&lt;br /&gt;
I don’t want to die in here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPSTR0OiLqkhZD6-wAGo7vg/featured&#34;&gt;One of my friends&lt;/a&gt; went Full Heel Turn some time ago, at least presumably according to the hundreds of motorists he’s caught on video violating traffic laws and thereby endangering his and other cyclists’ lives who would prefer to do so unrecorded and unconfronted. I think about him and his way of life fairly often. Some of his confrontations with these motorists are scary. He’s got more guts than I even think I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to have, to knowingly inconvenience entitled people in two-ton armored vehicles and then demand they respect his dignity and safety when they get affronted, like they so often do. But I bet he doesn’t have problems with not being noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;section id=&#34;its-all-right-there-in-front-of-you&#34; class=&#34;level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It’s All Right There In Front Of You&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m interested in trying to pick apart how this album is so effective, because it seems un-pick-apartable. You go to the album’s Genius page&lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;Because even though Genius serves up two and a half megs of Javascript to show you nine hundred bytes of text, it’s still the best place to find up-to-date lyrics, alas.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and look at the lyrics for the first song, “&lt;a href=&#34;https://genius.com/Mount-eerie-real-death-lyrics&#34;&gt;Real Death&lt;/a&gt;,” and tell me if you felt the need to click on any of those lyrics to have user annotations explain what they mean. The lines that hit the hardest, like “Real Death” and the first verse of “&lt;a href=&#34;https://genius.com/Mount-eerie-swims-lyrics&#34;&gt;Swims&lt;/a&gt;”, don’t need any, like, exegesis. It’s all right there in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don’t think it’s as simple as saying &lt;em&gt;A Crow Looked at Me&lt;/em&gt; derives its power from being plainspoken about emotional devastation. Another album from a couple years ago, Sun Kil Moon’s &lt;em&gt;Benji&lt;/em&gt;, took a similar tack, and I hated it. It struck me as ham-handed, an unsubtle attempt to manipulate the listener’s emotions and not worth listening to more than once. Why bother? There’s nothing more to get out of the lyrics. It’s all right there in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;a-pine-cone-your-squeaking-chair&#34; class=&#34;level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Pine Cone, Your Squeaking Chair&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case my own obvious ham-handedness in the last two paragraphs didn’t make it clear, my opposite stances on &lt;em&gt;A Crow Looked at Me&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Benji&lt;/em&gt; are untenable in light of my (remarkably similar) attempts to justify them. So why does &lt;em&gt;A Crow Looked at Me&lt;/em&gt; work so much better? Let me excerpt a couple lyrics that highlight the difference between the approaches taken in these two superficially similar albums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;Benji&lt;/em&gt;’s “Pray for Newtown”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when Christmas comes and you’re out running around&lt;br /&gt;
Take a moment to pause and think of the kids who died in Newtown&lt;br /&gt;
They went so young, who gave their lives&lt;br /&gt;
To make us stop and think and try to get it right&lt;br /&gt;
They went so young, a cloud so dark over them hung&lt;br /&gt;
And they left home, gave their mom and dad a kiss and a hug&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;A Crow Looked at Me&lt;/em&gt;’s “Toothbrush/Trash”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I just felt it for the first time&lt;br /&gt;
Three months and one day after you died&lt;br /&gt;
I realized that these photographs we have of you&lt;br /&gt;
Are slowly replacing the subtle familiar&lt;br /&gt;
Memory of what it’s like to know you’re in the other room&lt;br /&gt;
To hear you singing on the stairs&lt;br /&gt;
A movement, a pine cone, your squeaking chair&lt;br /&gt;
The quiet untreasured&lt;br /&gt;
In between times&lt;br /&gt;
The actual experience of you here&lt;br /&gt;
I can feel these memories escaping&lt;br /&gt;
Colonized by photos narrowed down and told my mind erasing&lt;br /&gt;
The echo of you in the house dies down&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the difference between these two excerpts, I actually hate &lt;em&gt;Benji&lt;/em&gt; a lot more than I did even the first time I listened to it. “Pray for Newtown” traffics in generalities and platitudes: “so young” not once but twice in one stanza, “gave their lives,” “a cloud so dark.” It reaches for some kind of moral lesson — “make us stop and think and try to get it right” — but again it’s so general as to be meaningless. And when it does deign to offer a concrete look at what it purports to portray, it feels like naked emotional manipulation (or just an attempt to make the lyrics scan) rather than an honest decision that those details improve the storytelling. Of course the kids gave their mom and dad a kiss and a hug before they left for school. This means nothing. It’s just clumsily pawing at my heartstrings. As my partner aptly put it when I was trying to talk through this post with her, it’s like Mark Kozelek read the Wikipedia entry on the Newtown shooting and used the information therein to write a song.&lt;span&gt;&lt;label for=&#34;sn-2&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sn-2&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;I’m sorry if you listened to &lt;em&gt;Benji&lt;/em&gt; and loved it. I didn’t start this post intending to bag on it so hard, and I know a lot of people thought it was great. But to me it just seems like dime-store pathos compared to the realness of the death in &lt;em&gt;A Crow Looked at Me.&lt;/em&gt; And I should be up front about one other factor: from what I’ve read, Mark Kozelek seems like he personally is often a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/04/i-interviewed-mark-kozelek-he-called-me-a-bitch-on-stage&#34;&gt;real&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stereogum.com/1709766/mark-kozelek-i-love-you-but-youre-bringing-me-down/&#34;&gt;asshole&lt;/a&gt;, where Phil Elverum seems like just the nicest and most gentle guy you can imagine. I’m sure this skews my opinion of their artistic output as well, so feel free to take it with as many grains of salt as you deem necessary.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast “Toothbrush/Trash,” of whose lyrics my excerpt comprises about half. (The stanza I quoted from “Pray for Newtown” is one of nine.) It’s spare, economical with words but generous with details about the quiet hell Phil Elverum is living. “Three months and one day after you died.” “You singing on the stairs, a movement, a pinecone, a squeaking chair.” It’s every bit as plainspoken as anything on &lt;em&gt;Benji&lt;/em&gt;, resorting only to the occasional figure of speech like “colonized by photos” and “the echo of you in the house.” But Phil Elverum ends lines with words that rhyme only when he can do so without compromising that straightforwardness, unlike “Pray for Newtown”’s clumsy “a cloud so dark over them hung.” Elverum has said that an alternate title for &lt;em&gt;A Crow Looked at Me&lt;/em&gt; could be “Death is Real.” It’s a phrase that opens the album, and one he repeats throughout it as the reality of the death in his life intrudes on him again and again, making him intolerable to share a grocery aisle with, crushing him under its weight when he lets his guard down and dares to imagine a future conversation he might have with his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Crow Looked at Me&lt;/em&gt; does a lot with very little. On first listen, it might seem like it’s stream-of-consciousness, like each song was recorded straight through, one take, no lyrics written down. But I can’t believe that’s the case at all. The ache I feel listening to this album is too much for these anecdotes not to have been selected and tweaked for maximum effect, rather than just plucked haphazardly out of a constant stream of such moments in Phil Elverum’s life and dropped onto an album with no artifice whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please. Please. Someday this or something like it will happen to me. I have to believe it’s not always this bad.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/containers/music/music2012&#34;&gt;Favorite Albums of 2012&lt;/a&gt; list omitted what was probably one of my most anticipated albums of the year. In fact, it didn’t make that list. The reason is not that it disappointed me—though in a way it did—but because even if it hadn’t it definitely would not be an album I’d want to return to often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album is Scott Walker’s &lt;em&gt;Bish Bosch&lt;/em&gt;. Scott Walker is a fascinating man, and his recent musical history (where “recent” means “since about when I was born”; this is “recent” relative to Walker’s musical career stretching back to the 60s) is such that the release of &lt;em&gt;Bish Bosch&lt;/em&gt; was quite a notable event. Walker’s last album &lt;em&gt;The Drift&lt;/em&gt; was released in 2006. Its predecessor &lt;em&gt;Tilt&lt;/em&gt; came out over a decade before that. In the 60s, Scott Walker was quite the pop heartthrob, I guess. His band The Walker Brothers had a hit single entitled “The Sun Ain’t Gonna Shine Anymore.” A few decades, fame-induced breakdowns and musical dead ends and false starts later, Walker is in another universe than ours, one where such a notion as “pop stardom” doesn’t exist, beaming back reports every five or ten years or so. It doesn’t sound like a pleasant place to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bish Bosch&lt;/em&gt;, even more than &lt;em&gt;The Drift&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Tilt&lt;/em&gt; before it, is an otherworldly album. There are few melodies, and what melodies there are sure as hell aren’t tonal. Instead there are suffocating swathes of microtonal strings; detuned, distorted guitars twanging forlornly or forebodingly; unidentifiable electronics chittering prickly menace; and wide expanses of near-silence or ominous drones. Taken as a whole, it’s a nasty, perplexing, often outright hostile and abrasive slab of ugly words and noise as pitch-black as its cover. But it’s compelling despite all that, enough that I feel the need to write about it four years on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to say the album flew under the radar of most people, and that I’m coming down from the mountain with a huge secret that no one else knows about. But it appeared on several other year-end lists, somewhat perversely. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/sashafrerejones/2012/02/housekeeping-best-music-of-2012.html&#34;&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/a&gt;. My erstwhile favorite review site &lt;a href=&#34;http://cokemachineglow.com/category/top-50-albums-2012/&#34;&gt;Cokemachineglow&lt;/a&gt;. It even made #1 on one list: according to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tinymixtapes.com/features/2012-favorite-50-albums-of-2012?page=4&#34;&gt;Tiny Mix Tapes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bish Bosch&lt;/em&gt; was the best album released in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is hilarious in light of Tiny Mix Tapes’s name. Will anyone ever put a song from &lt;em&gt;Bish Bosch&lt;/em&gt; on a mix tape? If I’d done so when I was making mix tapes for my girlfriend, she’d have thought I was a serial killer. Even “tiny” is laughable in this context. Any mix tape with a “late period” Scott Walker song on it is not tiny. Even his shortest songs can’t but be massive. All are black holes of the kind you can only form by compressing a novelette’s worth of fractured, inscrutable, hallucinatory lyrics, atonal melodies, and outright sound collage—years in the making—into a ten-song album totaling just over an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The penultimate song in the three-album trilogy of sorts that &lt;em&gt;Bish Bosch&lt;/em&gt; concludes, the shortest and possibly most digestible song in the whole batch (“digestible” being a nauseating and therefore appropriate word to use to refer to any song here, to be sure) is called “&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/nldLZg5FAUY&#34;&gt;Pilgrim&lt;/a&gt;”. It’s about two and a half minutes long and its lyric totals about thirty different words. It could be said to have a pretty conventional structure, with a repeated verse and a bridge, if the verse is the part where Walker rasps “Heya, heya, heya, heya / Room full of mice” over a carpet of skittering drums and the bridge is the part where he sing-speaks about blowing up bullfrogs with a straw. Like much of &lt;em&gt;Bish Bosch&lt;/em&gt;, it seems primarily about decay and wanton cruelty, if one had to say it’s “about” something. Other favorite subjects of Walker’s: disease (and the spread thereof), dictators (and the execution thereof).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s dark stuff, but Walker approaches it in an almost playful way. One of his favorite tricks is to take two seemingly unrelated ideas, toss them into a song together, and see what happens. Sometimes we get a kind of alchemy: he forges an unlikely connection between them, as in &lt;em&gt;The Drift&lt;/em&gt;’s “&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/D-OleuUs5Eo&#34;&gt;Jesse&lt;/a&gt;”, where he almost makes us believe that the shade of Elvis Presley felt the fall of the Twin Towers as an ache mirroring the absense of his twin brother who died at birth. The absurdity of the connection on its face makes it all the more affecting when Walker sort of pulls it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other times, as in &lt;em&gt;Bish Bosch&lt;/em&gt;’s “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YE2BeiQyt0&#34;&gt;The Day the ‘Conducator’ Died (An Xmas Song)&lt;/a&gt;”, the two ideas lie separate and inert. That song seems to make no attempt to tie together its “verse”’s unadorned recital of a personality questionaire (“Most of the chaos in my life is caused by / ○ Internal factors / ○ External factors”) and the “chorus” consisting of the single repeated line “Nobody waited for fire.” That line refers to the execution of the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, the Conducator of the title, where indeed the firing squad did not wait for the order to fire to do so. What are we to make of this juxtaposition? We’re left to connect the dots: is Walker suggesting that a personality inventory of this kind might determine if the &lt;em&gt;listener&lt;/em&gt; is the type who would “wait for fire”? Is he inviting us to laugh at the existence of such personality tests in a world where people won’t give a man—brutal dictator though he may have been—a dignified death? How does the single, final, horribly skewed personality test question “The mad dogs swarming from her groin / ○ You noticed / ○ Didn’t Notice” fit in to all this? If there even is a right answer to any of these questions, I wouldn’t expect to have found it with any of my speculation. But of course it does force me to speculate. It’s easy to Google most of the references and allusions that Walker employs in his lyrics, but that just leaves you with two or more unwieldy, amorphous blobs of information, and no inkling of how they’re supposed to fit together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could all be unlistenably, intolerably, unrelentingly oppressive if Walker didn’t also have a sense of humor and a pretty deft compositional touch. He breaks up his claustrophobically intense crushes of noise with equally agoraphobic expanses of near-silence, which are a relief until they start to become ominous. And, even more so on &lt;em&gt;Bish Bosch&lt;/em&gt; than before, his lyrics are shot through with non sequiturs which might have you raising an eyebrow or laughing out loud depending on how they catch you. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDmUESc30Ys&#34;&gt;Dimple&lt;/a&gt;”: “Frozen fast in the lowering night / In the lowering left-testicle night”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fqgl-SlxN0&#34;&gt;‘See You Don’t Bump His Head’&lt;/a&gt;”: “While plucking feathers from a swan song / Shit might pretzel Christ’s intestines”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ih7KzKLLWA&#34;&gt;Epizootics!&lt;/a&gt;”: “Oops, pardon the elbow / Let’s just shift you over here / Sorry / I’m so clumsy / Take that accidentally in the bollocks for a start”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pasFgQjKMww&#34;&gt;Corps de Blah&lt;/a&gt;”: “Nothing clears a room like removing a brain.” (Or putting on a late-period Scott Walker album, one assumes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, for every line such as the above, there are three more like “Epicanthic knobbler of ninon / Arch to Macaronic mahout in the mascon” or “Jutland is crooning narcrotic Lorilies” or “Down there, as ish kabibbles / Schlepp the shade forever.” &lt;em&gt;Bish Bosch&lt;/em&gt; has a higher density of words whose definitions I don’t know than probably any other piece of media I’ve ever consumed, and there’s evidence that many of the words are Joycean gibberish of Walker’s own devising. (“Narcrotic,” for example, used back-to-back in “Epizootics!” and “Dimple,” appears to be a made-up portmanteau of “necrotic” and “narcotic.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even through the haze of general inscrutability you can tell &lt;em&gt;Bish Bosch&lt;/em&gt; is preoccupied with decay. Decay of the body, of course, especially in “Corps De Blah,” but also decay of information like the Biblical contradictions skewered in “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtyadMfQclI&#34;&gt;Tar&lt;/a&gt;,” or “‘See You Don’t Bump His Head’”’s series of morbid snapshots: microscopic scavengers (“bdelloid rotifers” in the lyric) swarming, Donald Rumsfeld (“Rummy”) jabbering smugly, and “a tiny laugh” that “dirties everything it touches.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I haven’t even mentioned the album’s 20-minute centerpiece “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGGqnFF0rCA&#34;&gt;SDSS14+16B (Zercon, A Flagpole Sitter)&lt;/a&gt;” yet! It is, according to a press release in advance of &lt;em&gt;Bish Bosch&lt;/em&gt;, about two “brown dwarfs”: Zercon, a “Moorish jester” in the court of Attila the Hun, and SDSS14+16B, the coldest known substellar body in the universe. Apparently, over the course of the song, the former climbs a flagpole and turns into the latter, or tries to, or imagines he does. But I struggle to think anyone could determine this on their own if the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bishbosch.com/biog/&#34;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; hadn’t laid it out so clearly. A substantial part of the lyric consists of schoolyard insults (“Does your face hurt? / ’Cause it’s killing me!”), mostly not so much sung as declaimed, and bathroom-wall scrawlings like “For a Roman / Who’s proof that Greeks fucked bears / V, V, IX, VII, V, IV, I” (the Roman numerals, of course, being a phone number).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a little curious that so much of this monster track, skulking in the hollowed-out heart of &lt;em&gt;Bish Bosch&lt;/em&gt;, is so utterly trivial. Most of &lt;em&gt;Bish Bosch&lt;/em&gt; stares into the abyss, and boy does it stare back. In a way, “Zercon” does the same, but it also reassures us, with a wink: Don’t worry. Your grossness, your run-of-the-mill vulgarity and petty cruelty, these will live on long after you. And somehow even after all this hostility and nonsense, it’s affecting when Zercon leaves it below him and attains the solitude he apparently craved atop his lonely flagpole. The heterogeneous cacophony that he’s spent most of the song trying to escape drops out to be replaced by thin, asphyxiating high-pitched strings, and he wails, “It’s so cold / Infrared / What if I freeze / And drop into / the darkness?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; found it affecting, anyway. Maybe you will too, or maybe you’ll find something else affecting about &lt;em&gt;Bish Bosch&lt;/em&gt;, but whether positively or negatively or, more likely, some mixture of both, it will probably affect the shit out of you. That’s why, after being compelled by unknown forces to throw it on again recently, I was then compelled to crack open this thing I’d started writing about it three years earlier and finally finish it. Here it is. Give &lt;em&gt;Bish Bosch&lt;/em&gt; a listen. I promise it will be unlike anything you’ve heard before.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but I let iTunes manage my music on Mac OS X and have done so for years, since when it was only kind of bloated and annoying instead of incredibly bloated and annoying like it is now. So even though iTunes itself is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/2015/11/itunes-alternatives/&#34;&gt;kind of awful at this point&lt;/a&gt;, all my music is organized the way iTunes likes to organize it, and most options for buying music have iTunes integration. iTunes is and has always been the path of least resistance for music management on a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don’t like using iTunes to play music anymore. Hell, I don’t even like to have it open most of the time, if I can avoid it. So I use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.musicpd.org&#34;&gt;mpd&lt;/a&gt; to play music instead. It stands for &lt;strong&gt;m&lt;/strong&gt;usic &lt;strong&gt;p&lt;/strong&gt;layer &lt;strong&gt;d&lt;/strong&gt;aemon and it’s just a process that runs constantly in the background and plays music when you ask it to. It’s not very user-friendly out of the box. With the help of the venerable and surprisingly still actually alive &lt;a href=&#34;https://qsapp.com&#34;&gt;Quicksilver&lt;/a&gt;, I was able to make it more convenient and user-friendly. I set up a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/valrus/mpd_on_osx&#34;&gt;Git repository&lt;/a&gt; containing the helpers I used to set this up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My music playing needs are pretty minimal but I like to have them streamlined. Here’s what this setup can do in one keystroke:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search and play albums that iTunes knows about using Quicksilver’s fuzzy searching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the name of the song being played&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage playback using media keys on a standard Apple keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this path is not for the faint of heart. You should be comfortable with a terminal for it. At many points while setting it up I got the feeling I was continuing to work on it more out of sheer cussedness than because I thought it would ultimately be worth the time I was putting in. But now that I’ve blazed the trail maybe it will work a little better for you. Many of the difficulties stemmed from figuring out which dark corners of Quicksilver actually work as they’re supposed to, so hopefully those won’t cause you the same difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck! If you try this, let me know about it on &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/valrus&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or star (or open an issue on) my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/valrus/mpd_on_osx&#34;&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Mapping Grief By Reflections</title>
            <link rel="alternate" href="http://ian.mccowan.space/2015/10/15/Grief/" type="text/html" />

            <summary type="html">I mostly grieve second-hand.</summary>
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I mostly grieve second-hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some combination of societal pressure and natural personal inclination seems to have inoculated me against the first-hand variety, so that I can, for example, look at the following facts directly in their loathsome faces and be relatively unscathed by them: My cat Einstein, the first cat who was really &lt;em&gt;mine&lt;/em&gt;, rather than my family’s, is sick and going to die. The vet gave us a prognosis and at no point was there a mention of any time span greater than six months. We’re going to do what we can to spoil him and make him comfortable in this twilight of his life, and at some point — perhaps when he is no longer happy enough to grace us with his legendary, bone-shaking purr — we’ll have him put to sleep, and then all we’ll have of him will be memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstractly, it seems like those facts should be enough to make me a quivering mass. I mean, Einstein is like 18 now and I’ve been dreading the inevitability of having his health take a turn for probably a few years now. But now I’m in the midst of it, and how do I feel? Well, pretty fucking bad, actually, but mostly not in a sad way. Instead I’m anxious and fretful and distractable and I feel somehow &lt;em&gt;fragile&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weird physical manifestation of this fragility is sort of like a low-grade fever: a feeling that my skin is tender, like I have a mild sunburn on my chest and back. (I assume the slight edge of nausea is from anxiety.) But the real sense of fragility comes from the feeling that second-order grief could hit me even harder than it usually does. Second-order grief is listening to a sad song, or seeing someone else grieve openly. Maybe it’s that society trained me to respond to other people displaying grief even as it trained me out of doing so myself, or maybe it’s just that other people being unguarded with their emotions can get through my defenses in a way that I can’t do myself. The master’s tools can’t dismantle the master’s wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my father died suddenly, the first time I cried was over a week later, when I saw my brother — the one reknowned for his ability to hold an absolutely straight face through any attempts to faze him — break down. On the other hand, the song “Virtute the Cat Explains Her Departure,” by the Weakerthans, is one of the few things in this world that can &lt;a href=&#34;http://thevalrus.tumblr.com/post/17079159785/virtute-the-cat&#34;&gt;reliably bring me to tears&lt;/a&gt;. I love it, and hate it, precisely because of its ability to make me let down my guard in a way that it seems most other things can’t, and despite my girlfriend’s asking me “Why do you do that to yourself?” sometimes it just feels &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; to cry, the same way sometimes we intentionally do things that scare or hurt us in other ways. But now, in my current state of fragility, I’m afraid to listen to that song. Maybe I don’t want to cry when there’s a chance that some part of it might be real, that Einstein is sad and afraid and in pain and there’s nothing I can do about it. Usually I can resist anthropomorphizing him this way. But that song shatters my resistance in too many ways for me to risk it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someday soon I will wake up and, for the first time in nine years, there will no longer be an Einstein. I know this, and I can face it and be mostly unmoved. But if I listen to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bSdRizGYb0&#34;&gt;Woke Up New&lt;/a&gt;, even though it is about a person and not a cat, that “what do I do without you” will somehow make it real. And I’ll have to really confront how maybe, some cold winter morning after Einstein leaves, it will be cold, so I’ll put on a sweater and turn up the heat, and then, suddenly and without warning, the walls will begin to close in, and there will be absolutely nothing I can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;

            <id>http://ian.mccowan.space/2015/09/25/Poison_Season/</id>
            <updated>2015-09-25T05:20:00Z</updated>
            
            <summary type="html">I’ve mentioned the analogy in this post’s title to a couple hard-core Destroyer fans — my brother, and my best friend I’ve never met in person &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeff.hume.ca&#34;&gt;Jeff Hume&lt;/a&gt; — and both had an initial reaction that suggested nonplussedness or at least extreme puzzlement. So here’s what I mean.</summary>
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned the analogy in this post’s title to a couple hard-core Destroyer fans — my brother, and my best friend I’ve never met in person &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeff.hume.ca&#34;&gt;Jeff Hume&lt;/a&gt; — and both had an initial reaction that suggested nonplussedness or at least extreme puzzlement. So here’s what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t just mean that &lt;em&gt;Poison Season&lt;/em&gt; is the LP following &lt;em&gt;Kaputt&lt;/em&gt;, but let’s start with that fact. I mean that &lt;em&gt;Poison Season&lt;/em&gt; is both a recoiling from and an expansion on &lt;em&gt;Kaputt&lt;/em&gt; in a similar way that &lt;em&gt;Trouble in Dreams&lt;/em&gt; was to &lt;em&gt;Destroyer’s Rubies&lt;/em&gt;. I use the term “recoiling” because of an &lt;a href=&#34;http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9651-accidental-pop-a-conversation-with-destroyers-dan-bejar/&#34;&gt;interview Dan Bejar did with Pitchfork&lt;/a&gt; where he expressed discomfort, or something, at having found himself playing large festivals in the wake of &lt;em&gt;Kaputt&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember being at Coachella and thinking, “What the fuck am I doing here?” That’s just one obvious one. But I didn’t have to play Coachella. No one forced me. That was a choice and that’s me just dabbling in this certain careerist version of myself. It fucking exists! I don’t regret it, though, and I’m really proud of &lt;em&gt;Kaputt&lt;/em&gt;. But it became clear to me very quickly that there are a few places where I have no business being—and that I wasn’t going to be returning to those places again, whether out of my own volition or because I would not be invited back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same interview, you can (unsurprisingly) sense Bejar’s intent to withdraw from the crowd-pleasing pop of &lt;em&gt;Kaputt&lt;/em&gt; that ended up with him on the stage at Coachella in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I don’t have nor intend to try to look up interview evidence supporting it, I submit that this isn’t a new pattern. Prior to &lt;em&gt;Kaputt&lt;/em&gt;, the last time Bejar made a relatively straightforward and accessible rock record and got approving press for it, it was &lt;em&gt;Destroyer’s Rubies&lt;/em&gt;. He followed that up with &lt;em&gt;Trouble in Dreams&lt;/em&gt; which was possibly his most widely panned (well, let’s say &lt;em&gt;least critically lauded&lt;/em&gt;; Destroyer is a band that critics tend to love) album in a decade. Perhaps its best competition for that dubious prize would be 2002’s &lt;em&gt;This Night&lt;/em&gt;, which — insofar as any Destroyer album resembles another — is also probably the one most like &lt;em&gt;Trouble in Dreams&lt;/em&gt;: it’s guitar-heavy, a little glammy, a little shambolic, a little longer and more indulgent than it maybe needs to be. Of course, &lt;em&gt;This Night&lt;/em&gt; came a year after &lt;em&gt;Streethawk: A Seduction&lt;/em&gt;, certainly the most consistent and highly regarded Destroyer album pre-&lt;em&gt;Rubies&lt;/em&gt;! Keeping in mind that this post’s title’s analogy is a loose one, it would work equally well expanded to include &lt;em&gt;This Night&lt;/em&gt; : &lt;em&gt;Streethawk&lt;/em&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musically, Bejar alludes to &lt;em&gt;Poison Season&lt;/em&gt;’s having two main vibes, which are pretty apparent when you give it a spin. The straight-up 70s-ish pop rock of “Dream Lover” and “Times Square” is superficially reminiscent of several other Destroyer albums, and I’m pretty sure it actually re-uses a handful of riffs from &lt;em&gt;Trouble in Dreams&lt;/em&gt;. There’s also the chamber pop using classical instruments like you hear on the bookend/title tracks and in the first half of “Hell”. If the Destroyer album that &lt;em&gt;Trouble in Dreams&lt;/em&gt; most resembles is &lt;em&gt;This Night&lt;/em&gt;, what precedent does &lt;em&gt;Poison Season&lt;/em&gt;’s chamber pop have? Die-hard fans will already know where I’m going with this: &lt;em&gt;Your Blues&lt;/em&gt;, the MIDI-orchestrated (and enjoyable but also quite outré and critic- and mainstream-befuddling) follow-up to &lt;em&gt;This Night&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critical consensus has largely come to the conclusion that &lt;em&gt;Rubies&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Kaputt&lt;/em&gt; are Destroyer’s masterpieces to date, and like &lt;em&gt;Trouble in Dreams&lt;/em&gt; before it, &lt;em&gt;Poison Season&lt;/em&gt; sounds like a transitional work in the wake of one of those masterpieces: lacking its cohesion and instead sort of straddling two worlds, a little more uneven, a little harder to pin down, maybe a little harder to love, or maybe a little harder to admire and a little easier to love because of it. I don’t love &lt;em&gt;Poison Season&lt;/em&gt; but I didn’t want another &lt;em&gt;Kaputt&lt;/em&gt;, so I’m happy that it’s surprising and kind of murky and difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t mean to say that Bejar is starting to just tread old ground and repeat himself. These newer albums are also evolutions on the old ones they superficially resemble, and no one who’s listened to them more than a couple times would mistake &lt;em&gt;Trouble in Dreams&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;This Night&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Poison Season&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Your Blues&lt;/em&gt;. Nor do I mean to say that Dan Bejar’s artistic direction is informed only by his desire to avoid the glare of the spotlight: he’s clearly doing what interests him. Hell, he even said in an interview that &lt;em&gt;Poison Season&lt;/em&gt; is “what’s closest to [his] heart right now,” which is kind of delightful and reassuring coming from a man who in recent years has been given to pronouncements like “The English language seemed spent, despicable, not easily singable. It felt over for English; good for business transactions, but that’s about it,” and “I think I also lost complete interest and faith in indie rock music being a serious forum for writing” and (in his song “Grief Point”) “I have lost interest in music. It is horrible.” From the standpoint of that last quote, &lt;em&gt;Poison Season&lt;/em&gt; is a relief. It’ll never be my favorite Destroyer album, but it’s not something made by someone who’s lost interest in music, and we should all be thankful for that.&lt;/p&gt;

            <id>http://ian.mccowan.space/2015/04/07/Spacemacs/</id>
            <updated>2015-04-07T05:20:00Z</updated>
            
            
            <content type="html">&lt;section id=&#34;a-vimmers-emacs-prerequisites&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Vimmer’s Emacs Prerequisites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/2014/11/22/My_Own_Personal_Editor_War/index.html&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; I explained why Vim and Sublime Text ultimately disappointed me; in this one, I’m going to describe how I finally found at least temporary respite in Emacs and what it took to get me there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a rocky start with Emacs. Actually I had about four of them. There was never any question that I was going to use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.emacswiki.org/Evil&#34;&gt;Evil-mode&lt;/a&gt;, Emacs’s vi emulation layer. I understand that it arose from the ashes of several previous such efforts to become one of the most complete vi emulations available for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; text editor besides ones that derive from vi itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming from Sublime Text’s deeply inadequate or flawed vi emulation packages, Evil was a revelation. With very few exceptions, it really is just like using Vim. It’s all that other crap that Emacs does that I had to make sense of somehow and that tripped me up the first several times I made a serious attempt at learning it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the popular jokes about Emacs is that it stands for “Escape Meta Alt Control Shift”, a jab at the countless arcane key chords that you’re expected to use to invoke its mind-boggling array of features. Almost immediately, I decided that finding a way to avoid those chords in favor of using Vim-style key sequences mostly without modifiers would be a prerequisite for my using Emacs full time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this distinction a bit clearer: The key command to quit Emacs is &lt;code&gt;C-x C-c&lt;/code&gt;, which means “control-x followed by control-c”. Take a look at this &lt;a href=&#34;http://wttools.sourceforge.net/emacs-stuff/emacs-keybindings.html&#34;&gt;table of Emacs commands&lt;/a&gt; and you’ll get an idea why there’s a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs#.22Emacs_pinky.22&#34;&gt;whole flavor of RSI&lt;/a&gt; named for Emacs and why I wanted to just swap those key bindings out from the get go. What I really wanted was to bulk-convert all of Emacs’s RSI-inducing chords to key sequences like ones using Vim’s leader keys: for example, the aforementioned &lt;code&gt;C-x C-c&lt;/code&gt; might become &lt;code&gt;\xc&lt;/code&gt; or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first pass at this had me using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/chrisdone/god-mode/&#34;&gt;god-mode&lt;/a&gt; to take a bunch of the modifiers out of Emacs commands. But I had some trouble getting god-mode to play nice with Evil, even when I used the charmingly titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gridaphobe/evil-god-state&#34;&gt;evil-god-state&lt;/a&gt; to tie the two together. I suspect that this was actually a perfectly viable way to achieve what I wanted and some misunderstanding on my part prevented me from getting it working; I was too new to Emacs and tried to deviate from its norms too much too fast. If you use evil-mode and god-mode together I’d be interested to hear how it works for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this point I’d dipped my toes into Emacs enough to have a handle on Emacs Lisp, the (far superior to Vimscript) language used to do all of Emacs’s extensive customization. I’d tried the “build up an Emacs config from scratch” thing a couple times and ended up frustrated with it due to its being a total crap shoot whether any given plugin would play nice with evil-mode. So when I came across a starter kit whose tagline is “The best editor is neither Emacs nor Vim, it’s Emacs &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Vim!”, and which &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/doc/DOCUMENTATION.md#who-can-benefit-from-this-&#34;&gt;purports to be&lt;/a&gt; “first intended to be used by &lt;strong&gt;Vim users&lt;/strong&gt; who want to go to the next level by using Emacs”, I was 100% ready to jump feet-first into an unabashedly Evil-centric starter kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;spacemacs&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spacemacs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the link to that starter kit, which is called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs&#34;&gt;Spacemacs&lt;/a&gt;. It takes Vim’s leader key idea and kicks it into overdrive with the help of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cofi/evil-leader&#34;&gt;plugin&lt;/a&gt; that provides the same functionality in Evil, setting the leader key to space (whence the starter kit’s name) and using it to replace a whole bunch of Emacs chords with modifier-free key sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach is pretty similar to the one I had in mind with evil-god-state, though it doesn’t automatically translate Emacs bindings like I’d hoped. But that turned out not to be as big a problem as I thought: Emacs does so much that I don’t really &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to have it all at my fingertips. Manually setting up my bindings helps me compartmentalize, adding a few at a time and assimilating them while I note what continues to be most frictionful so I can try to ameliorate it in my next round of bindings. And Spacemacs sets up a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of bindings for you, using a sort of “namespaced” hierarchy that allows all those bindings to avoid stepping on each other’s toes while also encouraging mnemonics and working well with a nice feature that aids discoverability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not the only way that Spacemacs is smartly designed. Its overall architecture is such that it’s (relatively) welcoming for the newbie but has a framework for sensible extensibility when you get further into it. I’ll explain some of the things that were most helpful to me in making Emacs with Spacemacs my full-time editor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;getting-started-with-spacemacs&#34; class=&#34;level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting Started with Spacemacs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memorizing these bindings will enable you to get around in Spacemacs, if occasionally somewhat clumsily. They were my bread and butter before I started to do my own configuration. I’m only mentioning Emacs-specific bindings here; note that most of the basic functionality of Vim also works well in Spacemacs, like invoking Ex mode with &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; and using it to do things like save and open files, split windows, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SPC&amp;gt; f f&lt;/code&gt;: Mnemonic “find file”. Triggers the function &lt;code&gt;ido-find-file&lt;/code&gt;, which lets you use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.masteringemacs.org/article/introduction-to-ido-mode&#34;&gt;Ido&lt;/a&gt; to navigate your filesystem to find a file to open, starting from the directory of the current buffer. A crash course: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Tab&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will autocomplete. Deleting when there’s no text after a slash will go up a directory. &lt;code&gt;~/&lt;/code&gt; will take you to your home directly from anywhere. &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt; will take you to your filesystem root from anywhere. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Return&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will go into the selected directory or open the selected file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SPC&amp;gt; b b&lt;/code&gt;: Mnemonic “buffer buffer”. Opens a &lt;a href=&#34;https://tuhdo.github.io/helm-intro.html&#34;&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt; minibuffer with a list of all your open buffers as well as recently visited ones. The biggest thing to know about Helm is that &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Tab&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t autocomplete. Instead, Helm filters the list as you type and you just select the best match using &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Return&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. It does a great deal of more fancy stuff too, but for switching buffers, that will probably suffice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SPC&amp;gt; :&lt;/code&gt;: no mnemonic, but think of this as the Emacs equivalent of using &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; to bring up the Ex command line in Vim. It brings up a Helm buffer that you can use to find an interactive Emacs function to run. There are about thirty million of these and I’m not going to really mention any here, but if you’re reading something about Emacs and you see some hyphen-separated name like &lt;code&gt;emacs-do-thing&lt;/code&gt; it’s probably a function you can call using &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SPC&amp;gt; :&lt;/code&gt;. If you’re already familiar with Emacs (or looking at non-Spacemacs-centric Emacs docs), this is the equivalent of the ubiquitous &lt;code&gt;M-x&lt;/code&gt; binding, but better because of Helm’s fuzzy matching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SPC&amp;gt; h d f&lt;/code&gt;: Mnemonic “help define function”. Man, so I complained about Vim and Sublime Text in my last post here. Sublime Text’s documentation is mediocre at best whereas Vim’s is very good and thorough, but even after working with Vim’s generally excellent documentation, Emacs’s is a revelation. There’s a reason that the blurb on the official Emacs web page describes it as “the extensible, customizable, &lt;em&gt;self-documenting&lt;/em&gt; real-time display editor.” Being able to use this binding, in conjunction with Helm for fuzzy matching, to quickly find any function defined anywhere in Emacs including custom ones, and get generally very useful information about how to use it… it’s amazing how much of a difference it makes in learning how to use Emacs productively. Seriously, learn to love this binding. It even reports any custom bindings that are defined to invoke the function that you’re getting help on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SPC&amp;gt; h d k&lt;/code&gt;: Mnemonic “help define key”. Another example of Emacs’s excellent built-in help, this binding prompts for more keys and then tells you what they do. If you accidentally hit some key or something doesn’t do what you expect, this binding will tell you what it did. It’s slightly less useful than the previous binding in my experience, but still very useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SPC&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;: As in, hit the space bar and then just wait. A feature (alluded to above) called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kai2nenobu/guide-key&#34;&gt;guide-key&lt;/a&gt; will kick in and list the keys you can use to continue issuing a command, with a short description of what each does. At first most of them will start with “group”; this is the “namespacing” I was referring to earlier. For example, the previous two bindings in this list are in the “help-describe” subgroup of the “helm/help/highlight” top-level group. This hierarchical organization of bindings makes it reasonably plausible that you can discover the binding for a task you want using guide-key alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those bindings, along with Spacemacs’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md&#34;&gt;very good documentation&lt;/a&gt; of its own, should be enough to get you started on getting used to the brave new world of Emacs: if you’re a Vim user already, you’re probably familiar with the process of starting with a small set of commands and gradually incorporating new ones into your workflow as you learn where your friction areas are. You’ll have to go through that again with Spacemacs, but having a huge chunk of Vim’s functionality already available makes the process a lot smoother. I know, for example, that there’s a Spacemacs binding for saving a buffer, but I don’t yet know what it is because I always just use the Vim-style &lt;code&gt;:w&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that’s enough for you to get started using Spacemacs! It’s a really nice piece of work and it seems to be deservedly catching on like wildfire, so if you’re familiar with Vim and anything I’ve said here sounds appealing, you should give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Happy Arbitrary Number Of Convenient Yet Also Arbitrary Time Units Elapsed Since The Death of a Historical Figure— Whose Divinity, If You’re Reading This, You Probably Don’t Even Believe In— Happening to Match Our Physiologically-Based (But Also Arbitrary) Number System Representation Of An Actually Fundamental Universal Constant Day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time I was enthusiastic about Pi Day, but I’ve become a bit of a curmudgeon about it without even realizing it. Much of it is due to typical hipster nonsense, probably, the “I was into math before you posers,” kind of thing when I see like fifty pictures of pies pop up on my Facebook wall. But my first paragraph sums up my more palatable reason, which Vi Hart &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E9m6yDEIj8&#34;&gt;expounds on at even more length&lt;/a&gt; with somewhat more verve but about as much use of the word “arbitrary”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think that’s what my grumpiness about Pi Day comes down to: for a day ostensibly about celebrating a mathematical constant that’s remarkable for its timelessness and transcendence (little &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number&#34;&gt;math joke&lt;/a&gt; there) of human conventions, Pi Day sure is contingent on a lot of those conventions. Pi, as the ratio of a circle’s diameter to its circumference, cares not about what number system we use to express it, or what year it is, or (I’d claim, as a mathematical &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics#Platonism&#34;&gt;Platonist&lt;/a&gt;) whether humans or any intelligent life even exist to know about it and give it a name. It’s just there, and it will always be there. I don’t think I’m irreverent about Pi Day. I think it’s my reverence for pi that makes me feel Pi Day &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; is irreverent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, though… it is nice to see the oft-maligned discipline of mathematics get a day in the sun, however superficial I may find it. And as a lapsed mathematician it’s unbecoming for me to be too snooty about it. So despite the arbitrariness of the day, I wanted to blog about some of the paths that complaining about Pi Day led me down. This will be very, very digressive and stream-of-consciousness. But the point is that thinking about Pi Day, despite its &lt;em&gt;blatant disrespect&lt;/em&gt; of Pi’s sublime universality, can lead to some interesting if only tangentially related (another little &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_lines_to_circles&#34;&gt;math joke&lt;/a&gt; there) facts and curiousities. And isn’t knowledge what Pi Day should rightly be about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;arbitrary-time-units&#34; class=&#34;level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Arbitrary Time Units&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started thinking about the arbitrariness of Pi Day’s relation to the Judeo-Christian Gregorian calendar and what more universal and unambiguous metrics it’s based on. I don’t think there’s anything to be done about the (to me as a non-Christian) arbitrariness of Pi Day’s being relative to the date of the birth of Jesus Christ (does this mean that Pi Day should be far more meaningful to Christians, who attach a profound and universal significance to that date?), but what about the divisions of time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern science, which deals in &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson&#34;&gt;particles that exist for far less than one-billionth of one billionth of one second&lt;/a&gt;, would not be satisfied with the imprecision in the layperson’s definition of a second as 1/31,536,000 of the time it takes for the Earth to revolve around the sun (or 1/86,400 of the time it takes for it to rotate once). The difference between any such revolution and the next is surely long enough for countless Higgs bosons to be created and destroyed. But the second is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_unit&#34;&gt;Système International base unit&lt;/a&gt;. How is it measured these days in a way that’s good enough for science on this level?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is quite arcane:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but it’s interesting because of the lengths that people presumably had to go to in order to ground what we’d &lt;em&gt;already defined as a second&lt;/em&gt; in something that doesn’t change every time a comet swings by and tugs something a bit. And even decades after that definition was cooked up, it had to be amended to specify that it refers to the caesium atom &lt;em&gt;at a temperature of absolute zero&lt;/em&gt;, because the radiation implied by a nonzero ambient temperature can affect the above measurement. In practice, this means no real-world clock can &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second#Modern_measurements&#34;&gt;measure a second&lt;/a&gt; directly according to the strict definition. They have to use whatever temperature they can hold stable and extrapolate based on that what the measurement would be at absolute zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;how-universal-is-pi&#34; class=&#34;level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How Universal Is Pi?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the contortions necessary to make a “second” something that’s useful for high-precision science got me wondering whether my understanding of pi is as “universal” as I reverently assume it is. In particular, our value of 3.14 and so on is based on a circle in &lt;em&gt;Euclidean&lt;/em&gt; geometry, which is characterized by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair%27s_axiom&#34;&gt;axiom&lt;/a&gt; that given a line &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt; and a point &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; not on that line, there is exactly one line through &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; parallel to &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;. That seems obvious, but in fact you you can instead declare that &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_geometry&#34;&gt;there are &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; lines through &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; that parallel &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or that there are &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;infinitely many&lt;/em&gt; such lines&lt;/a&gt; and get &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Models_of_non-Euclidean_geometry&#34;&gt;perfectly coherent and even wildly useful systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you make the first of those two assumptions, you get something called spherical geometry, called that because things work as if they were all on a sphere. In spherical geometry, the angles of a triangle add up to &lt;em&gt;more than&lt;/em&gt; 180 degrees (or π radians, if you prefer) and there’s no such thing as parallel lines; &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; lines intersect. Circles on a sphere look much like they do in “flat” Euclidean geometry, (although some circles in spherical geometry, known as “great circles”, are &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle&#34;&gt;also lines&lt;/a&gt;) but if you measure distance along the surface of the sphere, their circumference-to-diameter ratio is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what we know as π! In fact that ratio is 2 for the great circles and &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.plover.com/math/pi.html&#34;&gt;gets closer to our π as the circles get smaller&lt;/a&gt;! Under the second assumption, in hyperbolic geometry, instead &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#Circles_and_disks&#34;&gt;the ratio is &lt;em&gt;greater&lt;/em&gt; than our π&lt;/a&gt; (though, again, it gets closer to π as the circles get smaller because both hyperbolic and spherical geometry look like Euclidean geometry if you zoom in real close).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So dang, I should reconsider my position on my high horse. The only reason I think of pi as “universal” is that I privilege Euclidean geometry over the spherical and hyperbolic kind! There’s no compelling &lt;em&gt;objective&lt;/em&gt; reason that we should say pi (defined as the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter) is approximately 3.14 at all; instead all we can say is that that’s the case &lt;em&gt;in Euclidean geometry&lt;/em&gt;. Pure mathematics views the three geometries I mention as derived from collections of axioms. By itself, it &lt;a href=&#34;http://euler.slu.edu/escher/index.php/The_Three_Geometries&#34;&gt;doesn’t favor any of them over the others&lt;/a&gt;. And why should &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; even prefer Euclidean geometry when we live on a sphere?&lt;sup id=&#34;ref1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#foot1&#34; class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;privilege&#34; class=&#34;level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Privilege&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing that the mathematical constant that I revere (so much that I smugly look down on those who celebrate it in a way that I think undercuts its real value) is actually contingent on a specific geometry which we designate as “the standard” one just because it’s most convenient to us is a sort of mathematical “checking my privilege.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Privilege&#34;&gt;Checking your privilege&lt;/a&gt; just means to acknowledge the biases that arise from your personal experience and circumstances (which may differ hugely from those of other people) when you think about or discuss an issue. It’s become a sort of shibboleth of the left wing in American political discourse. A lot of people think it’s primarily a way to shut down conversations about the kinds of “hot button” topics where privilege is most relevant: race, class, gender, religious belief, disabilities. And indeed it can be used that way. But I think it’s a valuable thing to &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.shrub.com/check-my-what/&#34;&gt;be aware of how your life experiences have been shaped by cultural forces&lt;/a&gt; and how those experiences shape your beliefs and assumptions in turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of π, what I thought was a universal and fundamental value turned out only to be applicable to one specific set of axioms: axioms which were (not to put too fine a point on it) &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#The_Elements&#34;&gt;laid out by a white man&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;ref2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#foot2&#34; class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in 300 BC. Of course I am not proposing that, had Euclid not been a white man, we would have discovered non-Euclidean geometry in less than the two millennia it actually took. But what if instead of following the paths laid down by a mathematician who did all his scratchwork on flat surfaces, we’d had other geometrical prodigies who used (cylindrical) tree trunks instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I follow a lot of disputes about pop culture and a common argument against adding “diverse” characters to media is that there’s no reason to “change” it or “try to make a statement.” People who make such arguments assume, based on privileges that they probably haven’t realized they enjoy, that the straight white male is the &lt;em&gt;default&lt;/em&gt; and that using characters who don’t fit that mold is a conscious choice to deviate from that default. But maybe some people don’t fit that demographic and have different defaults. Maybe, like with Euclidean, spherical and hyperbolic geometry, there’s not really a good reason to prefer just one of them and disciplines flourish when they stop pretending there is, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry#Discovery_of_non-Euclidean_geometry&#34;&gt;like geometry did at the beginning of the 19th century&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like there are solid reasons to prefer Euclidean geometry, but it’s what we’re taught in school, and the mathematical canon looked at &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; through that lens for almost two thousand years. Maybe math would be further along right now if we’d given those other geometries more credence between 300 B.C. and 1800 A.D. And maybe we’d make more progress faster even today if we aggressively gave more voice to people who don’t fit in with what people assume is the default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Appendix: My Favorite Facts About π&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally I omitted this section of this post, but I decided to add it as a palate cleanser and to demonstrate my solidarity with what I concluded earlier was the noble purpose of Pi Day: to spread the joy of mathematical knowledge. (Although I think that spreading awareness of privilege would be an even more noble purpose.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;strike&gt;two and a half&lt;/strike&gt; one and a half facts about pi that leap to my mind due to their surprisingness and elegance whenever the subject of “how pi is interesting” comes up. (One and a half because one of them is only sort of “about” pi, down from two and a half because in writing this I learned that one isn’t actually true.) Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;the-basel-problem-a.k.a.-the-sum-of-the-reciprocals-of-the-squares-of-the-natural-numbers&#34; class=&#34;level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Basel Problem, a.k.a. the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the natural numbers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soooo one of those names doesn’t tell you anything about this problem and the other is maybe a little dense to try to unpack, so this is a maybe slightly more friendly version of it: &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_problem&#34; title=&#34;Wikipedia page for The Basel problem.&#34;&gt;&lt;img title=&#34;The Basel Problem: what&#39;s the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the natural numbers?&#34; src=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/assets/images/posts/Pi_Day/basel.png&#34; class=&#34;fullwidth&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Clicking that image will take you to the Wikipedia page for the problem, which goes &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more in depth than I intend to here.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this fact because it’s easy to state precisely— twelve English words is &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; fewer than many interesting math problems take to state, and the mathematical representation is tidier still— but the result is extremely surprising and ties into some math so deep that I’d quickly be way over my head if I attempted to do more than gloss over it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not familiar with the notation, you only need to worry about the stuff after the second equals. The three things in between the equals signs all say the same thing. If you’re not familiar with infinite sums, they basically ask two questions: “if you keep adding those fractions up, will the sum eventually ‘even out’ at a particular number? If so, what number is that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the answer to the first question is “yes,” and the answer to the second one is “π²/6”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! You read that right. If you keep adding up those fractions, with the squares of the natural numbers in the denominators, the sum will keep getting closer and closer to π²/6. Where does the π come in when we’re adding up these simple fractions? Well, as you’ll see if you check that Wikipedia article, the answer involves some pretty sophisticated mathematical machinery and (you may have to take my word for this part) a sizable dollop of cleverness as well. Just to add up some (ok, infinitely many) simple fractions, and get an answer that involves an irrational number! The problem took 90 years to solve after it was first posed and another 6 to prove rigorously. It’s beautiful and elegant, one of my favorite mathematical facts. And as a bonus, it also relates to the function ζ, a.k.a. the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function&#34;&gt;Riemann Zeta Function&lt;/a&gt;: one of the most important functions in mathematics, with still more surprising implications relating to the distribution of prime numbers, one of math’s most enduring mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;average-river-sinuosity&#34; class=&#34;level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Average river sinuosity&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sinuosity of a river is the ratio of its length with all its twists and turns included to its length “as the crow flies.” Up until this very day, I believed that the average sinuosity of the world’s rivers was approximately equal to pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But thanks to the Internet, it’s not difficult to check this and find that it’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://pimeariver.com&#34;&gt;almost certainly not true&lt;/a&gt;. A gentleman who writes for the Guardian used the data crowdsourced in that last link to write a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2015/mar/14/pi-day-2015-pi-rivers-truth-grime&#34;&gt;column&lt;/a&gt; about the debunking. It turns out that the “fact” was based in part on a simulation, not actual measurements of real-world rivers. Perhaps in a more mathematically ideal world, where rivers are free to go where they will without being disrupted by weather or other large-scale geographic events, it would actually be true. But in this one, it appears it’s actually not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;eulers-identity&#34; class=&#34;level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Euler’s identity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my “half a fact” about pi, which &lt;em&gt;includes&lt;/em&gt; pi but isn’t really &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; it, but for my money it’s the most beautiful and elegant fact in mathematics. Behold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler&#39;s_identity&#34; title=&#34;Wikipedia page for Euler&#39;s identity.&#34;&gt;&lt;img title=&#34;Euler&#39;s identity, the most beautiful equation in mathematics.&#34; src=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/assets/images/posts/Pi_Day/euler.png&#34; class=&#34;fullwidth&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to take my word for it. The Wikipedia article linked from the picture above has an entire section entitled “Mathematical beauty.” Euler’s identity is even more elegant to state than the Basel problem, and it ties together five of the most fundamental and important mathematical constants— &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;, π, 0 and 1— in a totally unexpected and concise way. If there’s one thing that you as a (presumed) layperson can do to understand why mathematicians so often refer to their discipline as “beautiful,” it’s to learn about the different parts of Euler’s identity and why it’s so remarkable that they fit together in such a simple way. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; would be an excellent way to celebrate Pi Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;foot&#34; id=&#34;foot1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Actually, I know the reason for this. It’s the same reason that we use &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics&#34;&gt;Newtonian mechanics&lt;/a&gt; for when you throw a ball rather than relativity or quantum mechanics: it’s a hell of a lot simpler and more familiar, and for most of your purposes it’ll be more than good enough.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, Euclidean geometry does the job on a spherical Earth because, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth&#34;&gt;much to the detriment of many B.C. cultures&lt;/a&gt;, a sphere is an awful lot like a flat plane if you’re only looking at a tiny piece of it. &lt;a href=&#34;#ref1&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;foot&#34; id=&#34;foot2&#34;&gt;
Well, the Western canon certainly represents him as white. But then, it does the same for the middle-Eastern Jesus… &lt;a href=&#34;#ref2&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time after Vim opened my eyes to the power of a Real Text Editor and the fun and effortless feeling of modal editing, I tried to do as much code and longform writing as possible in it, or at least some editor with a decent emulation of its keybindings. But at some point in the last several years there’s been an explosion of good editors, many of which fit that latter criteria. So I took the opportunity to explore a few of them and try to find one that would do away with Vim’s shortcomings while still giving me that sweet, sweet modal editing that I so crave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What’s Wrong With Vim?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did I want to move away from Vim? It’s the original modal editor (well, not counting vi) and it has a &lt;a href=&#34;http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Vim_Tips_Wiki&#34;&gt;hugely&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimawesome.com&#34;&gt;robust&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vim.org/scripts/&#34;&gt;ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; and userbase that makes the solution to almost any problem a Google search away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it also has some limitations, baked in at a very low level, that grated on me more and more until I finally wanted to see if I could do better. Some of those limitations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bluntly, Vim is Just a Text Editor and attempts to &lt;a href=&#34;http://unlogic.co.uk/2013/02/08/vim-as-a-python-ide/&#34;&gt;turn it into an IDE&lt;/a&gt; are doomed to kludginess at best and frustration and failure at worst as you tack on dozens of plugins in order to achieve what any IDE worth its salt would call basic functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps the situation in the above point would be okay if the dozens of plugins I alluded to had better cross-platform support. But due to circumstances beyond my control I have to use Windows at work, and time and time again while trying to set up a Vim plugin I’d see something to the effect of “Tested on OS X and Linux, seems to work on Windows, but YMMV” in its GitHub readme. Pile enough code with disclaimers like that on top of itself and it’s a recipe for disaster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I know, I know: it’s open source, fix it yourself, yadda yadda. But Vim plugins are mostly written in &lt;a href=&#34;http://stevelosh.com/blog/2011/09/writing-vim-plugins/#making-vimscript-palatable&#34;&gt;Vimscript&lt;/a&gt;, a wonky, frustrating, Vim-exclusive language that I really have no interest in learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At some point in my investigation of other editors, I got addicted to having &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pylint.org&#34;&gt;a linter&lt;/a&gt; running alongside my editing in realtime. Since I code mostly in Python at work, a linter can catch a lot of errors before I run anything, which can save me a lot of time. But the only way to get the kind of asynchronous/multi-threaded process support that you need for real-time linting in Vim is to use an &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7057051&#34;&gt;experimental fork&lt;/a&gt; that will probably never be merged into Vim proper or some kind of other &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3307&#34;&gt;kludge&lt;/a&gt; which requires compiling an “external c helper application” and I bet works just &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; on Windows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Related to that last point: Vim dates from 1991, and looks it. It’s based on vi, which is from the late 1970s and ran only in a terminal. Vim has a “GUI” mode, but it’s little more than a glorified terminal: its rendering is strictly grid-based; it supports only one font at a time; and any “graphics” that you can get in it are actually just text, so even many of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kepbod/ivim/master/snapshot.jpg&#34;&gt;most attractive&lt;/a&gt; Vim setups have rough edges and a feeling of being dated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like a lot of other people, I have my fingers crossed that &lt;a href=&#34;http://neovim.org&#34;&gt;Neovim&lt;/a&gt; will get off the ground, because I think it will solve a lot of these problems. But I want an editor I can use and enjoy &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The final nail in Vim’s coffin, as far as using it for heavier IDE-type coding, was trying out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sublimetext.com&#34;&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt; for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;sublime&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sublime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sublime Text’s main advantages over Vim, for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its cross-platform support is better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its IDE-esque capabilities are better. In particular, I don’t think I’ve ever found a project management system that I like as much as ST’s, and its Goto Anything feature is really slick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It starts up faster than a Vim that’s sufficiently tricked out to be equally capable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It strikes a good balance between “just a text editor” and “fucking &lt;a href=&#34;http://fbksoft.com/6-tips-to-make-eclipse-lighter-prettier-and-more-efficient/&#34;&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It uses Python as an extension language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s much prettier than Vim. This is something that I’ve been led to believe I shouldn’t care about as a Coder, but I’m also a lifelong Mac user, so I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; care. Sue me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Vim, though, Sublime started to show cracks after a while. Unfortunately this happened after I already paid for it, but I got enough use out of it (and learned enough from it about what I will and won’t put up with in my tools) that I consider that money reasonably well spent. For the record, though, a list of my grievances:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The vi emulation plugin, “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/vintage.html&#34;&gt;Vintage mode&lt;/a&gt;,” seems decent at first glance but after sustained use turns out to be pretty &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sublimehq/Vintage/issues&#34;&gt;deficient&lt;/a&gt;: many commands are missing or behave incorrectly, and the plugin has had very few updates to fix them in the last couple years. (More on this later.) There’s an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guillermooo/Vintageous&#34;&gt;alternative&lt;/a&gt; third-party plugin that’s more complete, but it still has a brace of bugs and shortcomings that are frustrating to anyone used to actual Vim, particularly in the area of defining new keybindings. Basically, the vi emulation situation in Sublime is spotty at best.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cross-platform situation is better than Vim, but there are still some patchy bits of the preferences system that made sharing prefs in Dropbox between my work Windows machine and my home Mac a chore. In particular: the User preferences, where you’re &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to make your personal configuration changes, are shared on all platforms, which is suboptimal. To get platform-specific settings, I had to configure them in a place I wasn’t supposed to, which of course caused problems elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The developer is almost completely incommunicado. Bugs and feature requests are slow to be addressed if they’re addressed at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relatedly, documentation is often outdated or incomplete and shows no signs of being updated, so a &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/index.html&#34;&gt;community documentation&lt;/a&gt; project has arisen to fill in the gaps. This and the previous point are pretty unacceptable for a paid product, in my opinion. &lt;a href=&#34;http://yfl.bahmanm.com/Members/ttmrichter/software-reviews/sublime-text-2-review&#34;&gt;This review&lt;/a&gt; concurs, a little more frothily than this blog post. (NB: at least some of the quotes in the “Stupid, stupid docs” section have been excised from the unofficial docs, but I can corroborate that they were once there. Hell, I even submitted a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/guillermooo/sublime-undocs/pull/54&#34;&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt; to remove the worst of them myself.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I probably could have lived with these problems. Sublime has the nice asynchronous linting I crave and just the right amount of IDE features, and I encounter few enough bugs in my routine ST usage that my last two complaints were mostly ideological rather than practical. But still. There’s got to be something better, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, spoiler alert: after years as a Vim user hearing about how it’s a ridiculous nonsense program that’s too big for its britches, I’m currently using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&#34;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; and, on the whole, liking it more than I did Vim or ST when I got fed up with them. But because Emacs is not a text editor but a tiny universe, it took me four or five false starts before I finally found a way in that worked for me. I’ll describe it in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;

            <updated>2014-11-08T05:20:00Z</updated>
            
            <summary type="html">&lt;em&gt;If you don’t know what UTF-16 surrogates are and how they work, consider &lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/study/essays/unicode&#34;&gt;my Unicode essay&lt;/a&gt; required reading for this post.&lt;/em&gt;</summary>
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you don’t know what UTF-16 surrogates are and how they work, consider &lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/study/essays/unicode&#34;&gt;my Unicode essay&lt;/a&gt; required reading for this post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a story about the most confounding bug that I fixed at work this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;mangled-emoji&#34; class=&#34;level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mangled Emoji&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a problem with a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_C%2B%2B&#34;&gt;Visual C++&lt;/a&gt; program at work: it was mangling some emoji characters that it wrote to a text file using the probably non-standard &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yeby3zcb.aspx&#34;&gt;ccs flag&lt;/a&gt; (see the “Unicode Support” sub-section of that document) to encode them as UTF-16. The mangling happened like this example: instead of writing a 🎨, the program would write ��.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not your browser failing to display two characters. That’s what I saw in the text file, and I thought the same thing as you might have just now: that my editor was failing to display characters because it didn’t have a font for them or something. But I opened that file up in a hex editor: those two characters were supposed to look like that, because they were both the Unicode &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specials_(Unicode_block)#Replacement_character&#34;&gt;replacement character&lt;/a&gt;, code point U+FFFD. So it wasn’t that the text editor couldn’t display the output correctly. My C++ code was writing two replacement characters instead of an emoji for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;fruitless-debugging&#34; class=&#34;level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fruitless Debugging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the better part of an afternoon trying fruitlessly to figure out why this was happening, going so far as to follow the debugger down into the depths of Microsoft’s file-handling C code where every variable and function is prefixed by between one and three underscores and all data processing happens on the byte level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I am ordinarily a Python weenie, but this code was actually surprisingly easy to follow. Still, when you’re used to processing an entire file using one or two lines of code, it does all seem unbearably tedious.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I was able to ascertain to the best of my understanding that at the time the emoji’s bytes were actually copied to the file pointer, those bytes were indeed &lt;code&gt;d8 3c df a8&lt;/code&gt;, the UTF-16 encoding of 🎨, with the first two bytes constituting a surrogate. Nevertheless, when I opened that file after letting the program finish, there were those ��s like a pair of malevolent eyes, mocking me. Tormenting me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called it a day and went home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;sleeping-on-it&#34; class=&#34;level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sleeping on it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day I was able to look at the problem with fresh eyes. It’s a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/article/?id=10609&#34;&gt;commonly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/oct/27/uk.research&#34;&gt;reiterated&lt;/a&gt;—but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/8910111/Why-sleeping-on-a-problem-is-best.html&#34;&gt;scientifically&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-188135/Got-problem-Sleep-it.html&#34;&gt;defensible&lt;/a&gt;—&lt;a href=&#34;http://lifehacker.com/5953699/sleeping-on-difficult-problems-actually-helps-solve-them&#34;&gt;truism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;ref1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#foot1&#34; class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that if you get stuck on a problem, one of the most helpful things to do is sleep on it. I believe this and I’ve experienced it myself several times, but I’m still always surprised when it works, and this time was no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what my sleep-freshened eyes were able to see and synthesize the next day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem happened &lt;em&gt;inconsistently&lt;/em&gt;, in that if an emoji appeared twice in an input file, one of them might turn into ��s in the output file but the other might not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But it also happened &lt;em&gt;reliably&lt;/em&gt;, in that I could reproduce it in the same place every time I ran the program with the same input.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even down in the murky depths of the C libraries, there was no point at which I saw anything corresponding to �� in any buffer in the debugger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem happened &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; for the emoji in the output files. No other characters were affected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I mentioned this before, but to reiterate: the output file did actually contain the bytes corresponding to ��, and their appearing was not due to an issue with rendering or fonts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps the key insight I hadn’t had before: at no point during my debugging did I &lt;em&gt;actually see&lt;/em&gt; any code that would handle the encoding of the text (which was stored in arrays of 2-byte &lt;code&gt;wchar_t&lt;/code&gt;s in the code) to UTF-16 bytes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the last point in that list, it seemed like the problem &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to be in the UTF-16 encoding process that I wasn’t seeing, because it didn’t seem to be anywhere else. A problem with the encoding would certainly explain how the four bytes in the UTF-16 encoding of 🎨—two &lt;code&gt;wchar_t&lt;/code&gt;s’ worth—could turn into two replacement characters used to indicate an incorrect encoding. If you were to split those bytes in half in some reason, you’d get &lt;code&gt;d8 3c&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;df a8&lt;/code&gt;, neither of which are valid on their own in UTF-16 and would therefore get turned into replacement characters by an encoder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting this all together, I realized that the UTF-16 encoding must have been happening in an even murkier place than the ones I’d previously plumbed: when the emoji was flushed from a buffer onto the disk. This is common when writing to a file: when you send characters to a file handle, they’re actually sneakily just stored in memory until you have a big chunk of them that you can dump to the disk all at the same time and make that relatively slow disk IO worth the time it takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it just so happened that the C internals decided to flush my buffer in between the two &lt;code&gt;wchar_t&lt;/code&gt;s that constituted my emoji, they’d see a &lt;code&gt;d8 3c&lt;/code&gt; at the end of the first buffer and a &lt;code&gt;df a8&lt;/code&gt; at the beginning of the second one. The UTF-16 encoding process wouldn’t know what to do with either of them on their own, and by way of saying so, it’d turn both to replacement characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with many bugs that you work on consciously for six hours and subconsciously for another eight, the fix for this one took fewer than ten lines of code to manually flush the file buffer a little more often in order to ensure that it didn’t do so in the middle of a UTF-16 surrogate pair. It was kind of a lot of work to fix a very minor problem, but on the other hand, based on my fruitless Google searching to try to figure out what was going on here, I think I may have been the first one to find this bug in Microsoft’s UTF-16 handling, and that’s kind of exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, not with a bang but with a whimper does this post about my best bug fix of the year end. Sleep on your problems, folks. It works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li class=&#34;foot&#34; id=&#34;foot1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is the footiest footnote I think I’ve ever written in that it has nothing whatsoever to do with the main body of this post, but: when compiling these links from the front page of a Google search, the following did not escape my notice:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
People in the UK seem to be &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; fond of this idea; of the 5 links I used here, which constituted most of the aforementioned first page of search results, 4 are from UK websites; is “sleep on a problem” a British phrase?
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Also, 3 of the 5 articles I linked are accompanied by a stock photo of a conventionally attractive young white woman sleeping (it was 4 out of 5, but I replaced a Telegraph link with a Guardian one so I’d have 5 different sources)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Of the two articles that &lt;em&gt;weren’t&lt;/em&gt; accompanied by photos of that description, one (the Guardian) was written by a woman, and the other (the Daily Mail) has a whole side bar of crass and exploitative articles about celebs showing off their beach bods or whatever. Sooo I guess what I’m saying is I’m not trying to draw any sweeping conclusions from these observations, they just amused me when I was looking up these articles. &lt;a href=&#34;#ref1&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

            <updated>2014-07-11T05:20:00Z</updated>
            
            <summary type="html">Tone Poem needs to have areas to navigate.

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tone Poem needs to have areas to navigate. Because my primary inspiration for the overall game design is SNES-era console JRPGs, my first impulse was just to follow the lead of games like the venerable Final Fantasy VI. That game had a fair number of caves that looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/assets/images/posts/Tone_Poem_Maps/umaro-cave.png&#34; rel=&#34;bytebox&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;fullwidth&#34; src=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/assets/images/posts/Tone_Poem_Maps/umaro-cave.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But because it’s intended to be a game that teaches the player some real-world knowledge, it’s anticipated that the player may have to take multiple tries to get through Tone Poem’s areas. So I’d like to pinch the idea of procedural level generation from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/study/essays/roguelikes/index.html&#34;&gt;roguelike genre&lt;/a&gt; and apply it here, to prevent the player from having to slog through the exact same area several times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look again at the map linked above, there’s kind of a lot going on in it. Even ignoring the matter of how doors link up different areas, there are tiers connected only by stairs, bridges connecting an upper tier that can be walked under if you’re on a lower one, switches that have an effect on the layout, and chests placed so as not to block the narrow corridors. And then there are also the purely aesthetic elements like the lanterns and pipes across the ceilings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s certainly possible to generate this kind of thing on the fly, but it seems finicky and not at all fun to me, and the finickiness would only increase as I added more flavorful aspects. Perhaps more importantly, though, the more I thought about it, the more I didn’t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; my levels to be like this. One of the least fun things about classic JRPGs is trudging interminably across terrain at a frustratingly slow pace, being interrupted every ten seconds between points A and B to fight annoying pissant dudes when you really just want to get on with it. I want to try to avoid as much of that as I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I want to take a completely different tack with my areas and base them on graphs, in the mathematical sense. &lt;img src=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/assets/images/posts/Tone_Poem_Maps/graph.png&#34; class=&#34;right&#34; /&gt; Actually, maybe it would be less ambiguous to say “in the computer science sense” or “in the discrete mathematical sense”, because I’m not talking about the kind of graphs with &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; axes that we all dealt with in math class. I mean the kind that are covered in some detail in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory&#34;&gt;Wikipedia entry for “graph theory”&lt;/a&gt; and that are hugely important in things like search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll try to give a sense of how I use graphs to generate maps, and what the advantages and disadvantages of them are, in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Independent MIDI Handling in a Separate Thread&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MIDI handler I ended up using, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/olemb/mido/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mido&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, does basic decoding of the inscrutable stream of bytes that makes up a MIDI file. It converts them into &lt;code&gt;Message&lt;/code&gt; objects, easily inspectable representations of what the raw bytes actually mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mido&lt;/code&gt; has a method, &lt;code&gt;play&lt;/code&gt;, that applies this conversion to the data in a MIDI file and sends each message in turn to a function of your choosing &lt;em&gt;at the time it would occur&lt;/em&gt; if you were listening to the MIDI file normally. Times in MIDI messages are specified in something called “ticks”, and converting those to real time involves some annoying calculation, but &lt;code&gt;mido&lt;/code&gt;’s &lt;code&gt;play&lt;/code&gt; method handles all that for you. To use it, all I had to do was start a second thread and run &lt;code&gt;play&lt;/code&gt; in it, supplying a little boring logic to turn &lt;code&gt;Messages&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;pyfluidsynth&lt;/code&gt; calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble came when I tried to sync the thread playing the music with the one where the rest of the game’s logic happens. Beastie attacks, which were supposed to happen in time with the music, sounded off: worse, when I tried to make the music repeat, it did so too soon. In fact, though, I was correctly scheduling it to play every eight seconds. I’m pretty sure its sounding like it restarted too soon actually meant that it was playing too slow relative to Kivy’s scheduling clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;doing-it-myself-with-kivy&#34; class=&#34;level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Doing it Myself With Kivy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, as it seemed, eight seconds was enough for my MIDI thread to get out of sync with Kivy, the only sure solution I could think of was to clamp the MIDI down more tightly to Kivy’s clock. Fortunately, I had a rough model for how to do that in &lt;code&gt;mido&lt;/code&gt;’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/olemb/mido/blob/master/mido/midifiles.py#L362&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;play&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; method; unfortunately, because that method used &lt;code&gt;sleep&lt;/code&gt; to trigger messages at the right time, it effectively did its own scheduling so it wasn’t simple to substitute Kivy’s. I ended up doing two things I hate: copying code (&lt;code&gt;play&lt;/code&gt;), and using bits of &lt;code&gt;mido&lt;/code&gt; that were technically private code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll spare you (any more of) the details, but suffice to say that making this work was probably the hardest thing I’ve yet had to do while making Tone Poem. MIDI timing is idiosyncratic and finicky and I had to do a bunch of things myself that I thought I’d brought &lt;code&gt;mido&lt;/code&gt; on to take care of. On the other hand, the end result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keeps MIDI background music in sync with the events in the main thread&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does everything using Kivy’s clock, keeping me from having to coordinate two different scheduling systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;schedules MIDI events on the fly, which should allow me to manipulate them in realtime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last item means that I should be able to change the key or tempo of background music and have it take effect on the very next MIDI event, which may not be necessary but opens up a few interesting options in the future. It’s not a bad tradeoff for just over a hundred lines of somewhat gnarly code and a couple private API calls, and I’ll probably able to refactor that code to reduce some of the gnarliness. I’m cautiously happy about how it turned out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

            <updated>2014-07-03T05:20:00Z</updated>
            
            <summary type="html">A work friend and I were talking about this unfortunate piece of ad copy on Apple’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apple.com/ios/ios8/quicktype/&#34;&gt;iOS 8 QuickType web site&lt;/a&gt;.</summary>
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A work friend and I were talking about this unfortunate piece of ad copy on Apple’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apple.com/ios/ios8/quicktype/&#34;&gt;iOS 8 QuickType web site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iOS 8 predicts what you’ll likely say next. No matter whom you’re saying it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We work in the linguistics group at our company, and among most linguists, &lt;em&gt;prescriptivism&lt;/em&gt; is considered kind of a shabby way to look at language. Prescriptivism is basically the stance that one particular way of speaking or writing should be favored over others, and while we can all enjoy a good-natured chortle at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uQ_extNBDA&#34;&gt;Weird Al “fixing” a sign in a grocery store&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unnecessaryquotes.com/&#34;&gt;Unnecessary Quotes Blog&lt;/a&gt;, it’s both willfully blind to the mutability of language and sometimes very limiting to insist that everything needs to be grammatically “correct” all the time. “Whom” is technically correct here, but it sounds awkward and stilted for a company that likes to keep its products and advertisements approachable and down-to-earth. Using “who” instead might lose Apple points with prescriptivists, but I’d argue that it accomplishes their other goals much more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then take this other example, also from the Apple page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supported languages include English optimized for the U.S., UK, Canada and Australia; French; German; Italian; Portuguese optimized for Brazil; Spanish; and Thai. &lt;strong&gt;And,&lt;/strong&gt; Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese and Japanese Kanji input also continue to feature predictive input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite our best efforts not to wield prescriptivism against every text we see, my co-worker and I thought that “And,” at the beginning of a sentence was clunky. (Note that there is a prescriptivist injunction against starting a sentence with a conjunction like “and” or “although,” but we actually only object to the comma.) Is there a rule against starting a sentence with “and” followed by a comma? I don’t know, actually. But I still think it reads badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads me to the &lt;em&gt;prescriptivist’s dodge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/assets/images/posts/The_Prescriptivists_Dodge/prescriptivist-doge.jpeg&#34; rel=&#34;bytebox&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/assets/images/posts/The_Prescriptivists_Dodge/prescriptivist-doge.jpeg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, no, I’m sorry. That’s the prescriptivist’s &lt;em&gt;doge.&lt;/em&gt; The prescriptivist’s &lt;em&gt;dodge&lt;/em&gt; is objecting to language that &lt;em&gt;happens&lt;/em&gt; to be against some prescriptive norm, but not &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; it breaks that norm. No, the non-prescriptivist would never be so rigid and dogmatic! S/he objects only because this particular transgression—I’m sorry, I mean “choice”—&lt;em&gt;sounds bad&lt;/em&gt;. Just adhering to the admittedly arbitrary and archaic rules would, coincidentally, in this one particular case, result in something that sounds better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, “better” is subjective, and a lifetime of being taught that “correct” grammar is super important and seeing “incorrect” grammar and minority dialects associated with ignorance and stupidity will tend to affect your opinion of what sounds “better” without your having much say in the matter. But the prescriptivist’s dodge lets you continue to enforce fundamentally arbitrary norms without being one of &lt;em&gt;those assholes&lt;/em&gt; who comments on Facebook posts being all “I believe you meant ‘its’!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;oh my god this page’s URL is &lt;strong&gt;totally&lt;/strong&gt; missing an apostrophe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <updated>2014-02-20T05:20:00Z</updated>

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;python.org&#34;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; prides itself on having “batteries included”, which means it comes with a bunch of well-tested modules that can handle most use cases for a wide variety of common tasks. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.python.org/dev/library/argparse.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;argparse&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for command-line option and argument handling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.python.org/dev/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;elementtree&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for XML parsing and generation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.python.org/dev/library/urllib.request.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;urllib2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for fetching data from the Web (and elsewhere)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these helpful and robust modules can spoil programmers and leave them stymied when they run up against a task which isn’t well-supported by the standard library. I bumped into this when I tried to use Python to handle some MIDI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly, MIDI is a standard format for transmitting musical data. It’s been around for I think two or three decades, but it’s still sufficiently esoteric and its uses rare enough that it was never added to Python’s standard library. As a result, it occupies a kind of tool netherworld: trying to find Python code that handles all the things you can do with MIDI led me into a funhouse with “Unmaintained since 2006” or “Not well-tested” or “Does most of what I need, but” scrawled on every dead-end and shadowy corridor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a quick survey of the existing tools, I settled on working with two of them to do mutually exclusive MIDI-related tasks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-rtmidi&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rtmidi&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to handle reading data from a MIDI keyboard in realtime. The version number was worrisome, but it seemed like a simple enough task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mingus&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mingus&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to handle the transformation of MIDI files into musical data structures that can be manipulated using music theory. Again, ominous version number, but it seemed to be fairly robust and actually had unit tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This went well until I put together a brief track in Logic Pro and exported it to MIDI; mingus, on trying to read the resulting .mid file, failed with a complaint about a chunk of MIDI data that it couldn’t handle. I did some research into the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sonicspot.com/guide/midifiles.html&#34;&gt;MIDI file format&lt;/a&gt;, looked at mingus’s source code, and determined that while it was possible that there were events in my file that mingus couldn’t handle, the one it actually complained about wasn’t even present. Unfortunately, it seemed that mingus’s unit tests did not have great coverage in the area of MIDI file importing. I did not want to try to fix it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went out in search of a finer-grained tool. Mingus’s main job, it seems to me, is doing music theory; MIDI handling is ancillary and it shouldn’t have surprised me much that it was poorly tested. I found another library, mido, which handles MIDI without all the music theory, and tried to use it to read my problematic .mid file and pipe the messages into Mingus. I was able to get a “composition” in Mingus this way, but the note durations were screwy. I realized that Mingus’s representation of music data, as a purely linear series of “note containers”, was not really sufficient to represent an arbitrary piece of MIDI music. Even something as simple as having a note sound while the previous one is still ringing is not, as far as I can tell, representable by a Mingus data structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m reconsidering my choices now. What I absolutely need out of MIDI handling code is the ability to detect and handle basic (note data only) input from a MIDI keyboard, but it actually occurs to me that most other tasks are just nice to have. If I have a soundtrack in MIDI format, I don’t need to be able to read it into a data structure that can recognize and manipulate its music-theoretical properties. I really just need to be able to play it. Basic transposition or tempo changes are things I’d like to have the option of doing (and they would be much more difficult with audio data than with MIDI), but they don’t require sophisticated insight into the data. So I think perhaps I need to consider instead a configuration like this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mido&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mido&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for handling all MIDI, be it realtime or file-based. It has a promising version number, for what that’s worth, and has been worked on recently enough that there’s some hope of getting help if I run into trouble with it. I think I can use it to replace rtmidi as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;mingus&lt;/code&gt; for any music-theoretical shenanigans I want to do. Its MIDI handling seems like an afterthought now that I’ve checked it out, and so I’ll probably ignore it completely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyFluidSynth&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pyfluidsynth&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for playing MIDI sound. I think it’s included in mingus and it should be safe to use from there. I don’t know how robust it is but I’m pretty sure it’s just a thin wrapper around the quite old and well-tested fluidsynth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, this has all been kind of frustrating, but I think it’s also worth it for forcing me to think a little more precisely what I need to be able to do.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>2013 Music&#39;s Best Lines</title>
            <link rel="alternate" href="http://ian.mccowan.space/2014/01/14/Best_Lines_2013/" type="text/html" />
            <id>http://ian.mccowan.space/2014/01/14/Best_Lines_2013/</id>
            <updated>2014-01-14T05:20:00Z</updated>
            
            
            <content type="html">&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;
“Q: Do you fall so short of all that’s in your heart / When your friends, who you should pull up, you instead pick apart? / Do you watch the world get cold and crushed and small / And when you could do so much, you do fuck all?” –Okkervil River, “All The Time Every Day”
&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
The “Q” is in the lyric, yes (though not sung): this song is a questionnaire; this verse a question and, though a painful one, not an accusation; the answer is the chorus is the song’s title, repeated in various permutations in defiance, in the hope of exculpation, in anticipation of the final verse and its revelation that the singer/interrogator, too, has the same answer and that we should not be ashamed, but neither absolved. All we can do, perhaps, is what the singer does: try, but try we must, all the time, and every day.
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;
“Outside of the influential arms of your idolatries / The object will be turning goodbyes into good biology” –The Uncluded, “Organs”
&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
In a song which flips between tender emotion and ruthless pragmatism, between borderline PSA and animal mysticism, with as much charming awkwardness as it does Kimya Dawson’s childish verses and Aesop Rock’s gravelly verbosity, Aes delivers a couplet that concisely demonstrates the appeal of the whole Uncluded project. The strangely touching but still goofy play on words “goodbyes/good biology” is the icing on the cake.
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;
“This is born alone, die alone / So my dialog’s dastardly / Life’s a tragedy generator operating at max capacity” (El-P); “My pugnacious rhyme patterns prove pit bull in my pedigree / And dogs fight to the death. You say you better? You better be!” (Killer Mike), –Run the Jewels, “Twin Hype Back”
&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
It didn’t seem right to have a line from just one of these two here, so I picked a couple that illustrate the dichotomy making Run the Jewels so compelling. The main mode in which both of these two operate at pretty much all times is aggression, of course: most any thirty second slice of this album or either of their recent solo albums is sufficient to demonstrate that. El-P’s is born out of nihilism; Killer Mike’s out of arrogance or, sometimes, righteousness. El-P “never met a word [he] wouldn’t, like a weapon, just brandish”, and here they unroll out of him like a lash of barbed wire. Killer Mike, meanwhile, wields his like blunt instruments; I don’t even generally like alliteration but here he makes it work for me.
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;
“I’m a tired arachnid spinning loose in my threads, building lifetimes of gossamer beds / And the filigree water drops around my head, they absorb every word that I said / There are no wings hitched to my spine, just an undying urge to climb / And I’ll wait for my mother, supposing she’d bother to hold me and keep me awhile” –Laura Stevenson, “L-DOPA”
&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
L-DOPA, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-DOPA&#34;&gt;according to Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, is a chemical used to increase dopamine concentrations in the brain. The song seems to focus on Laura Stevenson’s somewhat fraught and distant relationship with her mother, but it also contains some of the most poignant and beautiful metaphors in any song I heard this year. This is the third of three of those metaphors and my favorite by a very thin margin. I have nothing to say by way of unpacking its meaning. I just think it is some of the most beautiful lyricism of 2013.
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;
“They be shooting whether it’s dark or not / I mean the days is pretty dark a lot / Round here it’s easier to find a gun than it is to find a fucking parking spot” –Chance the Rapper, “Paranoia”
&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
In an extremely obvious “secret” track after the freewheeling “Pusha Man” (who puts a secret song after the second track on an album?), Chance the Rapper brings some old-school Kanye-style frustration with the violence in his home city of Chicago. He’s practically gritting his teeth in this line, conflating his fear of that violence with a frustration that even bougeois-ass white people like myself can relate to, in a way that’s both funny and not.
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;
“The paramedic thinks I’m clever ’cause I play guitar / I think she’s clever ’cause she stops people dying” –Courtney Barnett, “Avant Gardener”
&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
This line is the best from among several good ones on Barnett’s pre-debut &lt;em&gt;Double EP: A Sea of Split Peas.&lt;/em&gt; I don’t think it needs a lot of explication. It’s just a great line.
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;
“Pockets stay on swole, peep the motherfucking cash flow / Niggas pay my loans just to finger fuck my asshole” –Cakes Da Killa, “Get Right (Get Wet)”
&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
Cakes Da Killa’s &lt;em&gt;The Eulogy&lt;/em&gt; starts with a minute or so of pitched up &lt;em&gt;MacArthur Park&lt;/em&gt; and then this line, and it sets the tone for the whole album in terms of campy audacity and graphic sexual forthrightness. It’s almost sure to induce a double take on your first listen and serves as a sort of “Abandon all homophobia, ye who enter here” warning.
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;
“What’s that in your gun holster? / Oh, this? It’s the de-negritizer / I shoot myself with it until I’m whiter than Peter Piper / Now I’ll be able to bow before a world leader’s miter / And tell them the shackles on my Adidas sneakers need to be tighter” –Busdriver, feature on Milo’s “The Gus Haynes Cribbage League”
&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
This is the line that made me sit up straight and pay attention to Busdriver. As with most rap lines, a significant portion of its appeal is in the delivery, and Driver’s captures the exact blend of insouciance, cynicism and sarcasm that I feel this one demands. Plus the internal rhymes and callback to the hook’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/18/us/adidas-shackle-shoes/&#34;&gt;Adidas shackle sneaker reference&lt;/a&gt; are sick. Sick enough that I don’t care that I’m not 100% sure what the man’s getting at; do white people have to kowtow to world leaders more than black people do? Really? That seems pretty equal-opportunity to me. Anyway, these two bars rule and Busdriver is my favorite rapper of 2013.
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yeezus&lt;/em&gt; isn’t all that terrible; in fact, most of my objections concern the lyrics. Musically, it’s everything its admirers say it is: trite as it may be, I have no problem calling it a &lt;em&gt;daring&lt;/em&gt; step for Kanye, or a &lt;em&gt;bold&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;uncompromising&lt;/em&gt; album coming from a man who is surely accustomed to having radio play. The only concession to radio-friendliness here is the presence of a few hooks, and even those are simple barked words or phrases as often as not: see the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdLsXB3AMAg&#34;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBAtAM7vtgc&#34;&gt;last&lt;/a&gt; (NSFW probably) songs. Nevertheless, the more I listen to it, the more I think I might end up liking the production here more than on any other Kanye album. Given different subject matter, &lt;em&gt;Blood on the Leaves&lt;/em&gt; might have been one of my favorite songs of the year. The brass that comes charging in at intervals is thrilling and foreboding, just one striking element of an instrumental that brings together so many disparate elements that it’s a wonder it works at all. The whole album is kind of like “Monster”, one of my favorite cuts from &lt;em&gt;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;, with the alienation and antagonism cranked up even further. Every one of the ten songs here has at least one line that makes me cringe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I find &lt;em&gt;Yeezus&lt;/em&gt; fascinating as a portrait of an extremely powerful and influential man nonetheless railing against his own powerlessness. “I Am A God” sums this up tidily, starting with its title (which at no point seems to be meant with any degree of irony) and ending with Kanye’s bloodcurdling screams, half terror and half frustration. They’re hardly the screams of someone who really thinks he’s a god, and it’s far more interesting to view his lazy, misogynistic, deadly self-serious lyrics as a façade over the turmoil of the production–one that gets pulled back, briefly and at the moment it seems thickest, for those screams–than to take them at face value. Because for all his power and fame, Kanye can’t stop the armchair psychiatrists of the world (including me) from diagnosing him every time he says what’s on his mind in an interview, can’t smash all the recorders that must hound him every time he’s out in public, can’t force the fashion world to take him seriously by dint of his myriad nigh-unimpeachable musical achievements. Can’t keep his mother from dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the face of this larger impotence, his lyrics find him still flaunting his wealth, raging about croissants, and of course, debasing and ejaculating in and on as many women as possible. Punching down is a time-honored tradition among people who feel powerless, so it’s not surprising to see Kanye doing it here if you accept the last paragraph’s thesis. But that doesn’t make it any less disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one psychoanalyzes Death Grips—who now have four albums and counting suffused with far more schizophrenic paranoia than &lt;em&gt;Yeezus&lt;/em&gt; has even in its worst moments—like this. But Death Grips never wrote a “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZOy6t1vVtE&#34;&gt;Roses&lt;/a&gt;” or “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7_jYl8A73g&#34;&gt;Runaway&lt;/a&gt;”, nothing to indicate that their shtick is anything other than just a shtick; they give few interviews and reveal little in them. Kanye’s whole life is a public spectacle, and while he might be playing a character on his albums, part of what makes his music compelling is that his songs seem to be come from an authentic, unfiltered place in him. Their details often match up with what we know of his life, and they have often revealed a complexity that is not much in evidence in the lyrics of &lt;em&gt;Yeezus&lt;/em&gt;. I think that’s to its detriment, so I try to read complexity into it elsewhere. To an extent, Mr. West has earned the benefit of the doubt from me. But &lt;em&gt;Yeezus&lt;/em&gt; is gross in too many trite and unchallenging ways for him to have earned a spot among my top ten this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Thanks to my friend Mary, a couple of whose thoughts in conversation about this album I have probably either knowingly or unknowingly incorporated into this post.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <updated>2013-12-08T05:20:00Z</updated>
            
            <summary type="html">Sonically, these two albums couldn’t be much more different. &lt;em&gt;Loud City Song&lt;/em&gt; is a mellow, generally very quiet and unassuming &lt;a href=&#34;http://juliashammasholter.com/&#34;&gt;Julia Holter&lt;/a&gt; joint, ecstatically praised by music critics as was its predecessor, last year’s &lt;em&gt;Ekstasis&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;UZU&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, is the long-awaited bombastic, diverse debut full-length from the Canadian visual art/music collective Yamantaka // Sonic Titan.</summary>
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sonically, these two albums couldn’t be much more different. &lt;em&gt;Loud City Song&lt;/em&gt; is a mellow, generally very quiet and unassuming &lt;a href=&#34;http://juliashammasholter.com/&#34;&gt;Julia Holter&lt;/a&gt; joint, ecstatically praised by music critics as was its predecessor, last year’s &lt;em&gt;Ekstasis&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;UZU&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, is the long-awaited bombastic, diverse debut full-length from the Canadian visual art/music collective Yamantaka // Sonic Titan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My expectations of how much I’d enjoy them also differed hugely. I didn’t know what to do with &lt;em&gt;Ekstasis&lt;/em&gt; and while it was interesting and novel, it never clicked with me at all. (This started to feel like a personal failing on my part when I saw someone compare it to Owen Pallett’s &lt;em&gt;Heartland&lt;/em&gt;, my second favorite album of 2010 and probably the one from that year with the most staying power.) But Yamantaka // Sonic Titan’s mini-album &lt;em&gt;YT // ST&lt;/em&gt; intrigued me by mixing charming, percussive pop (“&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k472YAVzoGU&#34;&gt;Hoshi Neko&lt;/a&gt;”) and punishing, endurance-testing hard rock (“A Star Over Pureland”) and managing to stay cohesive, a bit like a more serious, more proggy Deerhoof. I wasn’t always in the mood for &lt;em&gt;YT // ST&lt;/em&gt;, but every time I listened to it I liked it more. So I was really looking forward to &lt;em&gt;UZU&lt;/em&gt;, whereas &lt;em&gt;Loud City Song&lt;/em&gt; I picked up mostly out of curiosity and the hope of redeeming myself for my inability to appreciate &lt;em&gt;Ekstasis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, neither made it into my top 10, but &lt;em&gt;Loud City Song&lt;/em&gt; I liked considerably more than its predecessor, and &lt;em&gt;UZU&lt;/em&gt; a great deal less, and I’m lumping them together because of one characteristic that they, somewhat amazingly, share: rapping!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m using the loose &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping&#34;&gt;Wikipedia definition&lt;/a&gt; of rapping, here—“spoken or chanted rhyming lyrics”—but both albums feature parts that fall in that category quite neatly. The difference goes a surprisingly long way toward explaining my reaction to each album. The rapping on &lt;em&gt;Loud City Song&lt;/em&gt; is curious, but of a piece with the rest of the album: still quiet and contemplative, concerned with cocktail parties in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7paoM2cghjI&#34;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwu6bZDRWOM&#34;&gt;iterations&lt;/a&gt; of “Maxim’s” and the “flavor to the sound of walking” in “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5M8qRN_Rl0&#34;&gt;In the Green Wild&lt;/a&gt;”. It lends the songs in which it appears a focus on rhythm whose lack was, I think, part of what kept me from getting into &lt;em&gt;Ekstasis&lt;/em&gt;. I like it. Listen to &lt;em&gt;Ekstasis&lt;/em&gt; and the prospect of Julia Holter rapping will seem absurd, but here it feels like a natural extension of &lt;em&gt;Loud City Song&lt;/em&gt;’s sound. I still can’t make heads or tails of most of the lyrics, and most of the melodies aren’t strong enough to keep me trying. But the instrumentation is more diverse than on &lt;em&gt;Ekstasis&lt;/em&gt; and used well to create atmosphere. Atmospheric music is just not really my thing, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapping on &lt;em&gt;UZU&lt;/em&gt; is also a fairly natural extension of what’s elsewhere on the album, but unfortunately I find it dreadful. It ruins &lt;a href=&#34;http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=89iO84vztyM&#34;&gt;the track on which it appears&lt;/a&gt; for me and causes me to be preoccupied with its dreadfulness every time I think about listening to &lt;em&gt;UZU&lt;/em&gt;. I can’t find other reviews complaining about the utter dreadfulness of this rapping, so maybe this is all just my own biases, but I say if you sound like what I imagine &lt;a href=&#34;http://achewood.com/index.php?date=12262006&#34;&gt;Mister Band&lt;/a&gt; sounds like, it’s game over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s a shame, because there’s plenty of other enjoyable stuff on &lt;em&gt;UZU&lt;/em&gt; that shouldn’t be overlooked: more slow, quiet songs than on &lt;em&gt;YT // ST&lt;/em&gt;, for example, some of them quite affecting. The opening couplet of the last track, “Saturn’s Return”, is sung tenderly despite its ominous content: “Promises made long ago / set fire to the earth below.” That’s an intriguing enough piece of a story that it makes me want to listen to the rest of the album to see if I can find out what those promises were, and the ponderous piano in the backing track is a nice counterweight to the rollicking drums of “Bring Me the Hand of Bloody Benzaiten” and the thick, heavy guitars of “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KH3X4D0NyS8&#34;&gt;One&lt;/a&gt;.” This album’s pretty heavily backloaded, I think, and I like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But please save me from that dreadful rapping. I think it is symptomatic of one of the main reasons I don’t like &lt;em&gt;UZU&lt;/em&gt; as much as &lt;em&gt;YT // ST&lt;/em&gt;: it seems to take itself far more seriously. Too seriously, I feel, for a band that previously recorded “Hoshi Neko” and claims on their &lt;a href=&#34;http://paperbagrecords.com/artists/yamantaka-sonic-titan&#34;&gt;label’s page&lt;/a&gt; to merge “heavy metal’s brutish assault with Japanese manga’s cartoonish appeal”. &lt;em&gt;UZU&lt;/em&gt; has the brutish assault, but none of the cartoonish appeal. It’s not as &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; as its predecessor. So it’s not a bad album (aside from that rapping, I cannot emphasize that enough), but it won’t end up on my top 10 list.&lt;/p&gt;

            <link rel="alternate" href="http://ian.mccowan.space/2013/12/01/The_Golden_Age/" type="text/html" />
            <id>http://ian.mccowan.space/2013/12/01/The_Golden_Age/</id>
            <updated>2013-12-01T05:20:00Z</updated>
            
            <summary type="html">The musician who records under the name “Woodkid” is a Frenchman whose first full length album &lt;em&gt;The Golden Age&lt;/em&gt; is thoroughly lushly orchestrated but doesn’t skimp on the percussion. His beautiful, unique voice has the timbre of a bass clarinet and an accent that sounds, to my ears, not just not French but barely of this world. Over a bed of strings and horns that ebb and swell in all the right ways and drums that boom or clatter as appropriate, he deploys that voice in a way that I can only describe as “bloodless” in the hope of conveying why this album doesn’t resonate with me nearly as much as it seems to want to.</summary>
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The musician who records under the name “Woodkid” is a Frenchman whose first full length album &lt;em&gt;The Golden Age&lt;/em&gt; is thoroughly lushly orchestrated but doesn’t skimp on the percussion. His beautiful, unique voice has the timbre of a bass clarinet and an accent that sounds, to my ears, not just not French but barely of this world. Over a bed of strings and horns that ebb and swell in all the right ways and drums that boom or clatter as appropriate, he deploys that voice in a way that I can only describe as “bloodless” in the hope of conveying why this album doesn’t resonate with me nearly as much as it seems to want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not even that Woodkid’s singing is homogeneous, exactly: as a straightforward example, there’s a clear contrast between the muted verses and the more unrestrained chorus in “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTqufHTcti0&#34;&gt;Conquest of Spaces&lt;/a&gt;”. Even during the latter, though, it still feels like Woodkid is holding back. He never really seems to cut loose and just &lt;em&gt;bellow&lt;/em&gt; like I’m pretty sure he can and like the huge arrangements make me want him to; neither does his voice ever deviate much from a sort of emotional equilibrium. As you can hear in “Conquest of Spaces”, it mostly varies only in volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, unfortunately, the closest this album comes to emotional resonance is in the late ballad “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3LlofjeiSI&#34;&gt;Where I Live&lt;/a&gt;”: we get a hint of desperation in Woodkid’s raspy voice in the choruses and his near-gasps for breath in between lines. But in the next song and first single “&lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/21604065&#34;&gt;Iron&lt;/a&gt;”, he’s back to mostly letting the horns and drums take the reins. Don’t get me wrong, they do it admirably, the horns blaring out a hook that’s three parts martial and one part mournful before dropping into a dark percussion groove. The instrumentation on this album is &lt;em&gt;epic&lt;/em&gt;, and I mean that in the sense that it was meant before people on the Internet started using it to talk about their grilled cheese sandwiches and shit: if at least one of these songs don’t appear on a movie soundtrack inside of two years, I will be &lt;em&gt;shocked&lt;/em&gt;. Listen to the first twenty seconds of “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNIT5hM8c0&#34;&gt;The Great Escape&lt;/a&gt;” if you want to hear the kind of thing I’m talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the convincing filmic atmosphere of this album is is the key to the other reason it doesn’t hit home with me, though: there are few examples of its seeming to take many risks. In retrospect I alluded to this in the opening paragraph: every aspect of these songs, from the fist pumpers to the ballads, seems to fall along well-trod paths. It’s hard to qualify this feeling, but the paucity of emotion combined with the nagging impression that any given thirty-second excerpt was created for maximal soundtrack uptake makes these songs feel assembled rather than created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unfortunate that &lt;em&gt;The Golden Age&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t resonate with me, because if it did it’s so well executed that it’d probably be one of my favorite albums of the year. But in the end, I don’t feel much when I listen to it: some admiration, maybe, for the craft. But that’s not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>An Amendment to an Android Widget Tutorial</title>
            <link rel="alternate" href="http://ian.mccowan.space/2013/11/09/Android_Widget_Tutorial_Amendment/" type="text/html" />
            <id>http://ian.mccowan.space/2013/11/09/Android_Widget_Tutorial_Amendment/</id>
            <updated>2013-11-09T05:20:00Z</updated>
            
            <summary type="html">I’m trying to make an Android widget, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?&amp;amp;q=android+widget+programming&#34;&gt;Google turned up&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=&#34;http://kasperholtze.com/android/how-to-make-a-simple-android-widget/trackback/&#34;&gt;pretty straightforward and well-presented tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that I decided to follow to get a feel for things.</summary>
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to make an Android widget, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?&amp;amp;q=android+widget+programming&#34;&gt;Google turned up&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=&#34;http://kasperholtze.com/android/how-to-make-a-simple-android-widget/trackback/&#34;&gt;pretty straightforward and well-presented tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that I decided to follow to get a feel for things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tutorial was fairly easy to follow aside from the text boxes that were too narrow for the code samples, but it had some bits that were either out of date or, more likely, just wrong. So without further ado, I present some errata:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In step 4, you edit the widget’s &lt;code&gt;main.xml&lt;/code&gt; file, which the tutorial doesn’t explain should be located in &lt;code&gt;res/layout&lt;/code&gt; in your project. Most of it works, but:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;android:id&lt;/code&gt; attribute of the &lt;code&gt;LinearLayout&lt;/code&gt; tag is wrong, which is unfortunate. The tutorial mentions in step 3 that Eclipse will complain about &lt;code&gt;R.id.widget_textview&lt;/code&gt; and that it will be created shortly. It also mentions in step 4 that “the important thing is the id of our TextView, which we used earlier in the WatchWidget class.” But then it &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; gets it wrong. Oh well. The value of the &lt;code&gt;android:id&lt;/code&gt; attribute should actually be &lt;code&gt;&#34;@+id/widget_textview&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m fairly certain the widget background stuff is out of date. The background given is a single image, but the link to the Android docs take you to a page where the only available download is a whole folder of stuff. I don’t know how to use the single image provided, so I used the download instead. It contains a &lt;code&gt;res&lt;/code&gt; folder with a bunch of folders starting with &lt;code&gt;drawable&lt;/code&gt; in it. Their names were similar to those in my Android project’s &lt;code&gt;res&lt;/code&gt; directory, so I copied the icons generated by ADT when I set up my project into the downloaded &lt;code&gt;drawable&lt;/code&gt; folders and then copied them wholesale into my project, replacing the ones that already existed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you use the downloaded resources from the Android docs like I did, you have to change the &lt;code&gt;android:background&lt;/code&gt; attribute of the &lt;code&gt;LinearLayout&lt;/code&gt; tag of &lt;code&gt;main.xml&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;@drawable/appwidget_bg&lt;/code&gt;. Without knowing too much about it, I believe the downloaded folder contains different resources for different screen sizes. &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html&#34;&gt;This seems to be the relevant part of the Android docs.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 5 has you edit &lt;code&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/code&gt;. But it refers to a receiver named &lt;code&gt;WatchWidgetActivity&lt;/code&gt;, which doesn’t exist because in step 1 you unchecked “Create Activity”. It should instead refer to your AppWidgetProvider subclass. So change &lt;code&gt;.WatchWidgetActivity&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;WatchWidget&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it’s a minor issue, but in step 4, Eclipse will complain about your setting the attribute &lt;code&gt;android:text&lt;/code&gt; to a string literal. It should instead point to a string resource, because this aids greatly in &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/localization.html&#34;&gt;localization&lt;/a&gt;. So to fix the warning, change the value of &lt;code&gt;android:text&lt;/code&gt; to (say) &lt;code&gt;@string/test_time&lt;/code&gt;. Then open the file &lt;code&gt;res/values/strings.xml&lt;/code&gt; and add a new String resource whose name should be &lt;code&gt;test_time&lt;/code&gt;. Its value can be whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In step 6, &lt;code&gt;android:updatePeriodMillis&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;1000&lt;/code&gt;. Having any widget refresh once every second is probably a terrible idea. I set mine to &lt;code&gt;600000&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For a while in high school my mom and I went to an Indian buffet every Sunday, which had good and bad effects on my ability to cook for myself. On the one hand, it taught me about the variety of dishes in Indian cuisine; on the other hand, any Indian meal that lacks that variety now feels incomplete. And I can’t make an entire Indian buffet myself. Not in one night, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I can manage in one night is maybe two or three dishes: something time-consuming like chickpeas started in the morning or the previous night in a slow cooker, alongside a quicker dish like matar paneer and maybe something near-trivial like yellow dal cooked the night of. That’s enough of a spread to feel like the real deal, and such is the nature of Indian food that there are usually several days’ worth of leftovers for each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s when the fun begins, because (often with continued judicious use of the slow cooker) I can then make another dish every night or every other night for a while until I have five or six different dishes available. That’s pretty much a whole buffet’s worth of choices, and if I’m disciplined about eating the older things first, I can ensure that none of it goes to waste by tossing the remnants in the freezer when the selection tapers off. Then I can use those to kickstart things the next time I want to eat a whole bunch of Indian food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncuddled elses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is apparently one of Larry Wall’s stylistic preferences for Perl code, which means the creator of Perl is on record as being &lt;em&gt;anti-cuddles&lt;/em&gt;, which is just one more reason for me to despise Perl. I was led naturally to wonder whether Python is a pro-cuddle language. But what are cuddled elses? The venerable &lt;a href=&#34;http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CuddledElseBlocks&#34;&gt;c2 wiki&lt;/a&gt; comes to the rescue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an “if-then-else” statement, the following are examples of “cuddled” and “uncuddled” elses in C:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;|  /* cuddled &amp;quot;else&amp;quot; */  |  /* uncuddled &amp;quot;else&amp;quot; */   
|  if (x &amp;gt; 0) {          |  if (x &amp;gt; 0) {   
|      x += y;           |      x += y;   
|  } else {              |  }   
|      y += x;           |  else {   
|  }                     |      y +=x;   
                         |  }   &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, Python doesn’t have braces at all. But thanks to its syntactically significant indentation, its if/else statements more closely resemble the lefthand example than the one on the right. Because of this, I propose that Python can be said to have &lt;em&gt;phantom cuddles&lt;/em&gt; for its elses. Rest easy, Python fans. My tergiversation puts Python firmly in the pro-cuddle camp.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have a fairly deep background in pure math, and Haskell appears to be the purest and mathiest of the many functional languages that are getting more and more fashionable of late. So while one of my close co-workers recently took a course in Scala and my boss has dipped his toes in Erlang, I’ve chosen Haskell for my introduction to the functional language craze. Now we just need two of my other fellow software engineers to delve into OCaml and F# and we’ll have a royal flush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m still a rank amateur at Haskell and am going about it in a completely unsystematic way, but nevertheless I am making progress and wanted to document a couple recent breakthroughs of sorts that I’ve had with it. The first came so easily and elegantly that my eyes turned into hearts and I almost titled this blog post “Haskell is Cheating.” But then the second was a series of battles with foggy comprehension and unfamiliar paradigms that quickly eroded my optimism and then continued until I was nearly sure Haskell and I didn’t have a future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I worked it out, though, so now that I’ve bounced back a little I think I should document all this. The two breakthroughs came on &lt;a href=&#34;http://projecteuler.net/&#34;&gt;Project Euler&lt;/a&gt; problems 2 and 3, which is a little embarrassing but I did say I was a rank amateur. Just a little less of one today than I was yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;problem-2&#34; class=&#34;level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Problem 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://projecteuler.net/problem=2&#34;&gt;Problem 2&lt;/a&gt; was a lark. The statement of the problem is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: &lt;br /&gt; 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, … &lt;br /&gt; By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generating Fibonacci numbers comes probably just after Hello World and finding factorials in the Beginner Programming Problems Hall of Fame, and a straightforward recursive solution is easy in Haskell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceCode&#34; id=&#34;cb1&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode haskell&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode haskell&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;cb1-1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#cb1-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;fibo &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span id=&#34;cb1-2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#cb1-2&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;fibo &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span id=&#34;cb1-3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#cb1-3&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;fibo n &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; fibo (n &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; fibo (n &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that solution won’t memoize: if you ask it for &lt;code&gt;fibo 156&lt;/code&gt; it calculates &lt;code&gt;fibo 0&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;fibo 155&lt;/code&gt;, and then if you ask for &lt;code&gt;fibo 157&lt;/code&gt; it calculates them all again on its way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came across another solution that took me a little time to understand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceCode&#34; id=&#34;cb2&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode haskell&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode haskell&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;cb2-1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#cb2-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;fibs &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;∷&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span id=&#34;cb2-2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#cb2-2&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;fibs &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;zipWith&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;) fibs (&lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;tail&lt;/span&gt; fibs)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span id=&#34;cb2-3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#cb2-3&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span id=&#34;cb2-4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#cb2-4&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;fibo &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;∷&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;→&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span id=&#34;cb2-5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#cb2-5&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;fibo n &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; fibs &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;!!&lt;/span&gt; n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first and retrospectively stupidest question I had was how this memoizes any better than the naive solution above, but that is obviously because &lt;code&gt;fibs&lt;/code&gt; is an infinite list. Thanks to Haskell’s lazy evaluation, it fills up only as far as we ask it to (using &lt;code&gt;fibo&lt;/code&gt;) and stores everything preceding that. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of &lt;code&gt;fibs&lt;/code&gt; puzzled me but not for too long: &lt;code&gt;zipwith&lt;/code&gt; combines corresponding elements of two lists using the predicate that it takes as its first argument. So &lt;code&gt;fibs&lt;/code&gt; seeds the list of Fibonacci numbers with the first two, then generates subsequent ones by summing corresponding elements of that list and itself sans its first element (&lt;code&gt;tail fibs&lt;/code&gt;). To put it another way, you get subsequent entries in fibs by summing what you’ve got so far with the same shifted up by one. Sort of like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;plaintext&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fibs      0 1 1 2 3 5  8 
tail fibs 1 1 2 3 5 8  13  etc...
sum       1 2 3 5 8 13 21&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that was fine. What was beautiful, once I had that, was the actual solution to the problem. It looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceCode&#34; id=&#34;cb4&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode haskell&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode haskell&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;cb4-1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#cb4-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;even&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;takeWhile&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;4000000&lt;/span&gt;) fibs)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is about as close as you can get to just restating the problem in code. Read function applications from right to left: take Fibonacci numbers while they’re less than 40 million, filter out the even ones, and sum the result. It’s beautiful. That’s when my eyes turned into hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&#34;problem-3&#34; class=&#34;level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Problem 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, then there was &lt;a href=&#34;http://projecteuler.net/problem=3&#34;&gt;Problem 3&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. &lt;br /&gt; What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve done a whole bunch of Euler Project problems in Python, and I found it very helpful to build up a library of useful functions along the way. So I didn’t just want to solve this problem; I wanted to use it as an opportunity to add a &lt;code&gt;factors&lt;/code&gt; function, which would take an integer &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; and return a list of &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;’s prime factors, to my repertoire. After I did so, the solution to Problem 3 was a joke:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceCode&#34; id=&#34;cb5&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode haskell&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode haskell&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;cb5-1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#cb5-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;last&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; Euler.factors &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;600851475143&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming up with &lt;code&gt;factors&lt;/code&gt; was the part that gave me problems. Here’s the basic approach that I used and to which my eventual success hewed pretty closely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type=&#34;1&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a &lt;code&gt;divisible&lt;/code&gt; function to tell me if one number divides another. (This is just syntactic sugar for &lt;code&gt;n mod m = 0&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;divisible&lt;/code&gt; to find the first divisor &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; by checking everything between 1 and √n.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recursively call &lt;code&gt;factors&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;n / d&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure this is far from optimal but I believe it’s the approach I used in Python, it worked pretty well there, and it seemed to me that it would work even better in Haskell. Well…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most difficult thing about this problem actually turned out to be the √n part. Haskell has a built-in square root function for floating point numbers, of course, but unfortunately because of precision issues, just using it and then taking the floor of the result can &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Generic_number_type#squareRoot&#34;&gt;lead to wrong answers and overflow errors&lt;/a&gt; for large enough numbers. I’m making a repository of useful stuff, I want it to be better than that. So I went and swiped &lt;a href=&#34;http://haskellsolutions.blogspot.com/2009/02/integer-square-root-of-positive-integer.html&#34;&gt;some code based on Newton’s Method&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceCode&#34; id=&#34;cb6&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode haskell&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode haskell&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;cb6-1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#cb6-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;squareRoot &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;∷&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;→&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span id=&#34;cb6-2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#cb6-2&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;squareRoot n &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span id=&#34;cb6-3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#cb6-3&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; n &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;              &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span id=&#34;cb6-4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#cb6-4&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;otherwise&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; (k &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; ( &lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; n k)) &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span id=&#34;cb6-5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#cb6-5&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; k &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; squareRoot(n&lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I implemented everything else and tried it. It worked okay, but when I ran &lt;code&gt;factors&lt;/code&gt; on a six-digit number, it took probably ten to fifteen seconds. A back of the envelope calculation then yields about 200 days for the actual problem, assuming the runtime increased linearly, which it almost certainly would not have. Of course that didn’t matter, because when I compiled and ran the same test instead of using GHCi, I got a stack overflow error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured the problem was in my &lt;code&gt;factors&lt;/code&gt; definition. Some googling for the error yielded some interesting and, to me, unintuitive results about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Tail_recursion&#34;&gt;tail recursion&lt;/a&gt;. Sure enough, &lt;code&gt;factors&lt;/code&gt; was not tail call recursive; my recursive call did a division and a list append after returning. I floundered about with some attempts to force &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Performance/Strictness&#34;&gt;strict evaluation&lt;/a&gt; but they were more or less at random and so of course yielded nothing. Finally I added an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Performance/Accumulating_parameter&#34;&gt;accumulating parameter&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;code&gt;factors&lt;/code&gt; to make it properly tail recursive. The stack overflow persisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK. I decided to try some bigger guns and dip a toe into &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.12.2/html/users_guide/prof-heap.html&#34;&gt;Haskell profiling&lt;/a&gt;. I realize now that that page says &lt;em&gt;heap&lt;/em&gt; profiling, whereas I had a &lt;em&gt;stack&lt;/em&gt; overflow, which may be why the option that seemed to be necessary for me wasn’t on it. In any case, I did some more random flailing about with command line options that produced useless files before compiling using &lt;code&gt;ghc -prof -auto-all&lt;/code&gt; and running with &lt;code&gt;./problem3 +RTS -p -hy&lt;/code&gt; to get something useful: a file named &lt;code&gt;problem3.prof&lt;/code&gt; that told me most of my time was actually being spent in &lt;code&gt;squareRoot&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treachery! That innocuous-looking code I’d pilfered from the web was terrible! And now that I looked at it again, why the hell was it recursing on &lt;code&gt;n - 1&lt;/code&gt;? That would seem to mean that calculating the square root of 261,315 would require doing the same for 261,314 other numbers as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I scrapped that code and wrote a stupid binary search my damn self, using not one but two accumulating parameters to make sure it was tail-recursive. Here’s the result of my sweat and tears (no blood, I mean Jesus it’s just computer programming):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceCode&#34; id=&#34;cb7&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode haskell&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode haskell&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;cb7-1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#cb7-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;squareRoot&amp;#39; &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;∷&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;→&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;→&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;→&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dt&#34;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span id=&#34;cb7-2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#cb7-2&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;squareRoot&amp;#39; n g (&lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&#34;fu&#34;&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span id=&#34;cb7-3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#cb7-3&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; g&lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; n   &lt;span class=&#34;ot&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kw&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (g &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dv&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;op&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; n&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I’m not nearly as euphoric about this as I was about Problem 2. In fact I kind of hate this code. Accumulating parameters are gross and ugly and they make this function take way too many parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, according to the same profiling I’d done before, it appears that my code ran in about 2 μs, which I must admit is a significant improvement on 200 days (if the old slow code was linear) or the lifespan of the universe (if it was exponential). At some point I may go back and see which of my optimizations were necessary, but I think I’m done touching this code for now. Fighting with it was demoralizing at first, but I think it was necessary for me to get a more realistic idea of how Haskell operates.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Okay, I’m sure that by the time I need this again it will be defunct in some way because such is the nature of XCode, but nevertheless I’ve done this twice and struggled for way longer than necessary with what I think was more or less the same thing both times. So, for my own reference and that of anyone trying this for themselves, here’s the steps for how I successfully compiled &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Codeux/Textual&#34;&gt;Textual&lt;/a&gt; 3.1.0 with XCode 4.6.3. These instructions assume you have XCode and Git installed and some basic familiarity with the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type=&#34;1&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clone &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Codeux/Textual.git&#34;&gt;the Textual repo&lt;/a&gt; into some directory. I used &lt;code&gt;~/Code/Textual&lt;/code&gt; and did it with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mac.github.com/&#34;&gt;Mac Github app&lt;/a&gt; by clicking the “Clone in Desktop” button on the right side of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Codeux/Textual&#34;&gt;Textual’s Github page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check out a released version of Textual. Go to the folder where you checked it out and issue the command &lt;code&gt;git tag -l&lt;/code&gt; to list the available tags. Pick one (probably the one with the biggest number, I dunno) and do &lt;code&gt;git checkout tags/&amp;lt;tag&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;tag&gt; is the tag you chose. In this case it was &lt;code&gt;v3.1.0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow steps 3–5 in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.numlock.ch/news/mac_os_x/how-to-compile-textual-open-source-irc-client-on-mac-os-x/&#34;&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the “Frameworks” folder in your checked out Textual folder. It will have some subfolders in it: five, as of this writing. You care about three of them: “Auto Hyperlinks”, “Blowfish Encryption” and “System Information”. For each of these three, do the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the folder and then the “Source” subfolder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drag the file with the &lt;code&gt;.xcodeproj&lt;/code&gt; extension onto the “Main Project (Textual)” project in the Project Navigator in XCode. The Project Navigator is the left-hand sidebar with the little folder icon at the top selected; you may have to left-most button above the “View” control in the toolbar to turn it on. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ian.mccowan.space/assets/images/posts/Compiling_Textual/Adding_Frameworks.png&#34; rel=&#34;bytebox&#34;&gt;Here’s a screenshot summing up what does where.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn off code signing for the resulting (sub?)project in XCode. That means repeat step 5 from the instructions linked in step 3 above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow steps 6–8 in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.numlock.ch/news/mac_os_x/how-to-compile-textual-open-source-irc-client-on-mac-os-x/&#34;&gt;aforementioned instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The app will be in the &lt;code&gt;Build Results/Release&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory of your Textual checkout. Put it in your &lt;code&gt;Applications&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/li&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s happened often (well, twice) that I’ve had a Python module that started to get a little too big for its britches: maybe approaching 1000 lines, maybe just including several subclasses which are related but really ought to have their own files. Documentation on the Python packaging system can be a bit daunting. I don’t think I need to use &lt;code&gt;setuptools&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;distutils&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;distribute&lt;/code&gt; because this module is intended only for the use of me and my team. I just want to organize my code better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a module into a package is an easy way to make it possible to split it into different source files which are all available under the same name. In simple cases, you can do it with zero modification to the code that imports the module. As a very basic example: say you have a module in your &lt;code&gt;PYTHONPATH&lt;/code&gt; named &lt;code&gt;parts.py&lt;/code&gt; with two classes, &lt;code&gt;Widget&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Grommet&lt;/code&gt;. You want these two classes to have their own files, but still import them from &lt;code&gt;parts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, create a directory named &lt;code&gt;parts&lt;/code&gt; in the same location and two files named &lt;code&gt;Widget.py&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Grommet.py&lt;/code&gt; in it; move the source for each class into the corresponding file. Then create a text file in the &lt;code&gt;parts&lt;/code&gt; directory named &lt;code&gt;__init__.py&lt;/code&gt;. Edit &lt;code&gt;__init__.py&lt;/code&gt; and add the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceCode&#34; id=&#34;cb1&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode python&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode python&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;cb1-1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#cb1-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;im&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; Widget &lt;span class=&#34;im&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Widget&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span id=&#34;cb1-2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#cb1-2&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;im&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; Grommet &lt;span class=&#34;im&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Grommet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes &lt;code&gt;Widget&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Grommet&lt;/code&gt; accessible by using, e.g., &lt;code&gt;from parts import Widget&lt;/code&gt; or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sourceCode&#34; id=&#34;cb2&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;sourceCode python&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;sourceCode python&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;cb2-1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#cb2-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;im&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; parts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span id=&#34;cb2-2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#cb2-2&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;parts.Widget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just as when the two were both in the &lt;code&gt;parts.py&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;Widget&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Grommet&lt;/code&gt; have some shared code, you can put that code in a third file, alongside the files for the two classes, and import it into those files normally. Now if you want to, say, add a subclass to &lt;code&gt;Widget&lt;/code&gt;, you can do so in &lt;code&gt;Widget.py&lt;/code&gt; without cluttering up the &lt;code&gt;Grommet&lt;/code&gt; code.&lt;/p&gt;

            <summary type="html">I recently discovered the &lt;code&gt;StringIO&lt;/code&gt; module and have been using it surprisingly often.

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently discovered the &lt;code&gt;StringIO&lt;/code&gt; module and have been using it surprisingly often. It’s not a terribly flashy module, being roughly equivalent to a C++ &lt;code&gt;stringstream&lt;/code&gt;, but it is proving useful more than I expected. There are a couple use cases that have come up more than once just in the last couple weeks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m trying to run a command that produces output to stdout and read that output with a function that expects a file. Instead of piping the command’s output to a file, I can just initialize a &lt;code&gt;StringIO&lt;/code&gt; with the result of &lt;code&gt;subprocess.check_output()&lt;/code&gt; and pass it into the function. Intermediate files suck and I hate them. Using a &lt;code&gt;StringIO&lt;/code&gt;, by contrast, is so fresh and so clean, clean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m trying to write unit tests for functions or methods that read things from files. A unit test that depends on a file isn’t very, you know, unit-y. So instead I can keep it all in the test suite by putting the contents of a test file into a &lt;code&gt;StringIO&lt;/code&gt; and passing that to the function or method I want to test. Poof, no filthy, error-prone external files sitting around and begriming the purity of my unit tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, at least the second of these things seems obvious: like it should be a bog-standard way to write unit tests that don’t depend on external resources. But I’ve done a fair amount of cruising StackOverflow and other places looking at Python unit test best practices and haven’t ever stumbled across it before.&lt;/p&gt;
