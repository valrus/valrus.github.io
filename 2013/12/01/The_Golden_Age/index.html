    <h1>
Woodkid, <i>The Golden Age</i>
</h1>
    
    
<p>The musician who records under the name “Woodkid” is a Frenchman whose first full length album <em>The Golden Age</em> is thoroughly lushly orchestrated but doesn’t skimp on the percussion. His beautiful, unique voice has the timbre of a bass clarinet and an accent that sounds, to my ears, not just not French but barely of this world. Over a bed of strings and horns that ebb and swell in all the right ways and drums that boom or clatter as appropriate, he deploys that voice in a way that I can only describe as “bloodless” in the hope of conveying why this album doesn’t resonate with me nearly as much as it seems to want to.</p>
<p>It’s not even that Woodkid’s singing is homogeneous, exactly: as a straightforward example, there’s a clear contrast between the muted verses and the more unrestrained chorus in “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTqufHTcti0">Conquest of Spaces</a>”. Even during the latter, though, it still feels like Woodkid is holding back. He never really seems to cut loose and just <em>bellow</em> like I’m pretty sure he can and like the huge arrangements make me want him to; neither does his voice ever deviate much from a sort of emotional equilibrium. As you can hear in “Conquest of Spaces”, it mostly varies only in volume.</p>
<p>So, unfortunately, the closest this album comes to emotional resonance is in the late ballad “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3LlofjeiSI">Where I Live</a>”: we get a hint of desperation in Woodkid’s raspy voice in the choruses and his near-gasps for breath in between lines. But in the next song and first single “<a href="http://vimeo.com/21604065">Iron</a>”, he’s back to mostly letting the horns and drums take the reins. Don’t get me wrong, they do it admirably, the horns blaring out a hook that’s three parts martial and one part mournful before dropping into a dark percussion groove. The instrumentation on this album is <em>epic</em>, and I mean that in the sense that it was meant before people on the Internet started using it to talk about their grilled cheese sandwiches and shit: if at least one of these songs don’t appear on a movie soundtrack inside of two years, I will be <em>shocked</em>. Listen to the first twenty seconds of “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxNIT5hM8c0">The Great Escape</a>” if you want to hear the kind of thing I’m talking about.</p>
<p>I think the convincing filmic atmosphere of this album is is the key to the other reason it doesn’t hit home with me, though: there are few examples of its seeming to take many risks. In retrospect I alluded to this in the opening paragraph: every aspect of these songs, from the fist pumpers to the ballads, seems to fall along well-trod paths. It’s hard to qualify this feeling, but the paucity of emotion combined with the nagging impression that any given thirty-second excerpt was created for maximal soundtrack uptake makes these songs feel assembled rather than created.</p>
<p>It’s unfortunate that <em>The Golden Age</em> doesn’t resonate with me, because if it did it’s so well executed that it’d probably be one of my favorite albums of the year. But in the end, I don’t feel much when I listen to it: some admiration, maybe, for the craft. But that’s not enough.</p>
