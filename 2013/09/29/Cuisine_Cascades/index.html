    <h1>Cuisine Cascades</h1>
    
    <p>For a while in high school my mom and I went to an Indian buffet
every Sunday, which had good and bad effects on my ability to cook for
myself. On the one hand, it taught me about the variety of dishes in
Indian cuisine; on the other hand, any Indian meal that lacks that
variety now feels incomplete. And I can’t make an entire Indian buffet
myself. Not in one night, anyway.</p>
<p>What I can manage in one night is maybe two or three dishes:
something time-consuming like chickpeas started in the morning or the
previous night in a slow cooker, alongside a quicker dish like matar
paneer and maybe something near-trivial like yellow dal cooked the night
of. That’s enough of a spread to feel like the real deal, and such is
the nature of Indian food that there are usually several days’ worth of
leftovers for each.</p>
<p>So that’s when the fun begins, because (often with continued
judicious use of the slow cooker) I can then make another dish every
night or every other night for a while until I have five or six
different dishes available. That’s pretty much a whole buffet’s worth of
choices, and if I’m disciplined about eating the older things first, I
can ensure that none of it goes to waste by tossing the remnants in the
freezer when the selection tapers off. Then I can use those to kickstart
things the next time I want to eat a whole bunch of Indian food.</p>
